<p class='pindent'>May has ever been the favorite month of the year
in poetical description; but the praises so lavishly
bestowed upon it took their rise from climates more
southern than ours. In such, it really unites all the
soft beauties of Spring with the radiance of Summer,
and has warmth enough to cheer and invigorate,
without overpowering.</p>

<p class='caption'><span class='bold'>THE MALLARD.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='it'>Anas Boschas.</span> Green-head, Gray-duck.<br/><span class='bold'>THE AMERICAN WIDGEON.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='it'>Anas Americana.</span> Bald-pate.</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Both these beautiful ducks, perhaps, with the exception
of the lovely Summer Duck, or Wood Duck,
<span class='it'>Anas Sponsa</span>, the most beautiful of all the tribe, are
along the seaboard of the Northern States somewhat
rare of occurrence, being for the most part fresh
water species, and when driven by stress of weather,
and the freezing over of the inland lakes and rivers
which they frequent, repairing to the estuaries and
land-locked lagoons of the Southern coasts and rivers,
as well as to the tepid pools and warm sources of
Florida, the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama and Louisiana,
in all of which States they swarm during the
summer months.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On many of the inland streams and pools of New
York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the Far West
in general, including all the bays, shallows and tributaries
of the Great Lakes, as well as all the lovely
smaller lakes of New York, especially where the
wild-rice, or wild-oat, <span class='it'>zizania aquatica</span>, is plentiful,
they are found in very great numbers, especially
in the spring and summer time, nor are they unfrequently
killed on the snipe-grounds of New Jersey,
around Chatham, Pine-brook, and the Parcippany
meadows on the beautiful Passaic, and on the yet
more extensive grounds on the Seneca and Cayuga
outlets, in the vicinity of Montezuma Salina, and the
salt regions of New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the shallows of the lake and river St. Clair,
above Detroit, on the <span class='it'>rivière aux Canards</span>, and the
marshes of Chatham in Canada East, all along the
shores of Lake Erie on the Canadian side, especially
about Long Point, and in the Grand River, they literally
swarm; while in all the rivers, and shallow
rice-lakes on the northern shores of Lake Huron,
which are the breeding-places of their countless
tribes, they are found, from the breaking up of the ice
to the shutting up of the bays and coves in which
they feed, in numbers absolutely numberless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Mallard is generally believed to be the parent
and progenitor of the domestic duck, which, although
far superior in beauty of plumage and grace of form
and deportment, it very closely resembles; yet when
or where it was domesticated, is a question entirely
dark and never to be settled. It is certain that the
domestic duck was unknown to the Greeks and Romans,
so late as to the Christian era, although the
paintings in the Egyptian tombs demonstrate beyond
a peradventure that it was familiar to that wonderful
people from a very remote period; as it is also
known to have been among the Chinese, who rear
and cultivate them to a very great extent. Indeed,
it is I think in the highest degree probable that the
Duck, in its domestic state, is an importation into
Europe from the East, where, as I believe in every
quarter of the globe, the Mallard is a common and
indigenous native of the fresh waters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Mallard, or wild drake, commonly known in
the Eastern States as the Green-head, westward as
the Gray Duck, and in Alabama as the English
Duck, weighs from thirty-six to forty ounces, and
measures twenty-three inches in length, by thirty-five
in breadth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bill is of a yellowish-green color, not very
flat, about an inch broad, and two and a half long
from the corners of the mouth to the tip of the nail;
the head and upper half of the neck are of a deep,
glossy, changeable green, terminated in the middle
of the neck by a white collar, with which it is
nearly encircled; the lower parts of the neck, breast and
shoulders are of a deep, vinous chestnut; the covering
scapular feathers are of a kind of silvery-white,
those underneath rufous, and both are prettily crossed
with small, waved threads of brown. Wing coverts
ash, quills brown, and between these intervenes the
<span class='it'>speculum</span>, or beauty spot, common in the duck tribe,
which crosses the wing in a transverse, oblique direction.
It is of a rich, glossy purple, with violet or
green reflections, and bordered by a double streak of
sooty black and pure white. The belly is of a pale
gray, delicately crossed and penciled with numberless
narrow, waved, dusky lines, which on the sides
and long feathers that cover the thighs are more
strongly and distinctly marked. The upper and
under tail coverts, lower part of the back and rump,
are black, the latter glossed with green; the four
middle tail feathers are also black, with purple reflections,
and, like those of the domestic duck, are
stiffly curled upward. The rest are sharp-pointed,
and fade off to the exterior edges from brown to dull
white. Iris of the eye bright yellow, feet, legs and
webs reddish-orange, claws black.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The female, and young male until after the first
moult, is very different in plumage from the adult
drake, partaking none of his beauties, with the exception
of the spot on the wings. All the other parts
are plain brown, marked with black, the centre of
every feather being dark and fading to the edges.
She makes her nest, lays her eggs—from ten to sixteen
in number, of a greenish white—generally in the
most sequestered mosses or bogs, far from the haunts
of man, and hidden from his sight among reeds and
rushes. To her young, helpless, unfledged family,
and they are nearly three months before they can
fly, she is a fond, attentive and watchful parent, carrying
or leading them from one pool to another, as
her fears or inclinations direct her, and she is known
to use the same wily stratagems, in order to mislead
the sportsman and his dog, as those resorted to by
the ruffed grouse, the quail and the woodcock, feigning
lameness, and fluttering, as if helplessly wounded,
along the surface of the water, until she has lured
the enemy afar from her skulking and terrified
progeny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Mallard is rarely or never shot to decoys, or
<span class='it'>stools</span> as they are termed, since these are but little
used except on the coast, where this duck is, as I
have previously observed, of rare occurrence, although
it is occasionally found in company with the
Dusky Duck, <span class='it'>anas obscura</span>, better known to gunners
as the Black Duck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like the Dusky Duck,” says Mr. Giraud, in his
very clever and agreeable manual on the birds of
Long Island, “when pursued by the sportsman, it
becomes shy and feeds at night, dozing away the day
out of gun-shot from the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Early in the month of July, 1837, while hunting
over the meadows for smaller game, I came upon a
pair of Mallard Ducks, moving slowly down the
celebrated ‘Brick-house creek.’ The thought occurred
to me that they were a pair of tame ducks
that had become tired of the monotony of domestic
life, and determined on pushing their fortunes in the
broad bay. As I advanced they took wing, which
undeceived me, and I brought them down. They
proved to be an adult male and female. From this
circumstance I was led to suppose that they had bred
in the neighborhood. I made a diligent search, and
offered a sufficient bounty to induce others to search
with me—but neither nest nor young could be found.
Probably when migrating, they were shot at and so
badly wounded as to be unable to perform their fatiguing
journey, perhaps miles apart, and perchance
only found companions in each other a short time
before I shot them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the young birds are about three-fourths
grown, and not as yet fully fledged or able to fly
strongly, at which age they are termed <span class='it'>flappers</span>, they
afford excellent sport over water-spaniels, when they
are abundant in large reed beds along the brink of
ponds and rivers. When full grown, moreover, when
they frequent parts of the country where the streams
are narrow and winding, great sport can be had with
them at times, by walking about twenty yards wide
of the brink and as many in advance of an attendant,
who should follow all the windings of the water and
flush the birds, which springing wild of him will so
be brought within easy range of the gun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Mallard is wonderfully quick-sighted and
sharp of hearing, so that it is exceedingly difficult to
stalk him from the shore, especially by a person coming
down wind upon him, so much so that the acuteness
of his senses has given rise to a general idea
that he can detect danger to windward by means of
his olfactory nerves. This is, however, disproved
by the observations of that excellent sportsman and
pleasant writer, John Colquhoun of Luss, as recorded
in that capital work, “The Moor and the Loch,”
who declares decidedly, that although ducks on the
feed constantly detect an enemy crawling down upon
them from the windward, will constantly, when he is
lying in wait, silent and still, and properly concealed,
sail down upon him perfectly unsuspicious, even
when a strong wind is blowing over him full in their
nostrils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For duck shooting, whether it be practiced in this
fashion, by stalking them from the shore while feeding
in lakelets or rivers, by following the windings
of open and rapid streams in severe weather, or in
paddling or pushing on them in gunning-skiffs, as is
practiced on the Delaware, a peculiar gun is necessary
for the perfection of the sport. To my taste, it
should be a double-barrel from 33 to 36 inches in
length, at the outside, about 10 gauge, and 10 pounds
weight. The strength and weight of the metal
should be principally at the breech, which will answer
the double purpose of causing it to balance well
and of counteracting the call. Such a gun will carry
from two to three ounces of No. 4 shot, than which
I would never use a larger size for duck, and with
that load and an equal measure of very coarse powder—Hawker’s
ducking-powder, manufactured by
Curtis and Harvey, is the best in the world, and can
be procured of Mr. Brough, in Fulton Street, New
York—will do its work satisfactorily and cleanly at
sixty yards, or with Eley’s <span class='it'>green</span>, wire cartridges,
which will permit the use of shot one size smaller,
at thirty yards farther. The utility of these admirable
projectiles can hardly be overrated, next to the
copper-cap, of which Starkey’s water-proof, central-fire,
is the best form, I regard them as the greatest of
modern inventions in the art of gunnery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such a gun as I describe can be furnished of first-rate
quality by Mr. John Krider of Philadelphia, Mr.
John, or Patrick Mullin of New York, or Mr. Henry
T. Cooper of the same city, ranging in price, according
to finish, from one hundred to one hundred and
fifty dollars, of domestic manufacture; and I would
strongly recommend sportsmen, requiring such an
implement, to apply to one of these excellent and
conscientious makers, rather than even to import a
London gun, much more than to purchase at a hazard
the miserable and dangerous Birmingham trash,
manufactured of three-penny skelp or sham drawn-iron,
got up in handsome, velvet-lined mahogany
cases, and tricked out with varnish and gimcrackery
expressly for the American market, such as are offered
for sale at every hardware shop in the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The selling of such goods ought to be made by law
a high misdemeanor, and a fatal accident occurring
by their explosion should entail on the head of the
sender the penalty of willful murder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Mallard is found frequently associating in
large plumps with the Pintail, or Sprigtail, another
elegant fresh water variety, the Dusky-Duck on fresh
waters, the Greenwinged Teal in winter to the
southward, and with the Widgeon on the western
waters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the big and little pieces—two large moist savannas
on the Passaic river in New Jersey, formerly
famous for their snipe and cock grounds, but now
ruined by the ruthless devastations of pot-hunters and
poachers—I have shot Mallard, Pintail, and Black
Duck, over dead points from setters, out of brakes,
in which they were probably preparing to breed,
during early snipe-shooting; but nowhere have I
ever beheld them in such myriads as in the small
rice-lakes on the Severn, the Wye, and the cold
water rivers debouching into the northern part of lake
Huron, known as the Great Georgian Bay, and on
the reed-flats and shallows of Lake St. Clair, in the
vicinity of Alganac, and the mouths of the Thames
and Chevail Ecarté rivers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am satisfied that by using well made decoys, or
stools, and two canoes, one concealed among the
rice and reeds, and the other paddling to and fro, to
put up the teams of wild fowl and keep them constantly
on the move, such sport might be had as can
be obtained in no other section of this country, perhaps
of the world; and that the pleasure would well
repay the sportsman for a trip far more difficult and
tedious, than the facilities afforded by the Erie Rail-road
and the noble steamers on the lakes now render
a visit to those glorious sporting-grounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The American Widgeon, the bird which is represented
as falling headforemost with collapsed wings,
shot perfectly dead without a struggle, in the accompanying
woodcut, while the Mallard goes off safely,
quacking at the top of his voice in strange terror,
though nearly allied to the European species, is yet
perfectly distinct, and peculiar to this continent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is thus accurately described by Mr. Giraud,
although but an unfrequent visitor of the Long Island
bays and shores:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bill short, the color light grayish blue; speculum
green, banded with black. Under wing coverts white.
Adult male with the coral space, sides of the head,
under the eye, upper part of the neck and throat
brownish white, spotted with black. A broad band
of white, commencing at the base of the upper mandible,
passing over the crown.” It is this mark
which has procured the bird its general provincial
appellation of “Baldpate.” “Behind the eye a
broad band of bright green, extending backward on
the hind neck about three inches; the feathers on the
nape rather long; lower neck and sides of the breast,
with a portion of the upper part of the breast reddish
brown. Rest of the lower parts white, excepting
a patch of black at the base of the tail. Under tail
coverts the same color. Flanks brown, barred with
dusky; lower part of the hind neck and fore part of
the back undulated with brownish and light brownish
red, hind part undulated with grayish white; primaries
brown; outer webs of the inner secondaries
black, margined with white—inner webs grayish
brown; secondary coverts white, tipped with black;
speculum brilliant green formed by the middle secondaries.
Length twenty-one inches, wing ten and a
half. Female smaller, plumage duller, without the
green markings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Widgeon breeds in the extreme north, beyond
the reach of the foot of civilised man, in the boundless
mosses and morasses, prodigal of food and
shelter, of Labrador, and Boothia Felix, and the fur
countries, where it spends the brief but ardent summer
in the cares of nidification, and the reproduction
of its species.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the spring and autumn, it is widely distributed
throughout the Union, from the fresh lakes
of the northwest to the shores of the ocean, but it
is most abundant, as well as most delicious where
the wild rice, <span class='it'>Zizania pannicula effusa</span>, the wild
celery, <span class='it'>balisneria Americana</span>, and the eel-grass,
<span class='it'>Zostera marina</span>, grow most luxuriously. On these
it fares luxuriously, and becomes exceedingly fat,
and most delicate and succulent eating, being almost
entirely a vegetable feeder, and as such devoid of any
fishy or sedgy flavor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the spring and autumn it is not unfrequently
shot in considerable numbers, from skiffs, on the
mud banks of the Delaware, in company with Blue-winged
Teal; and in winter it congregates in vast
flocks, together with Scaups, better known as Bluebills,
or Broadbills, Redheads, and Canvasbacks, to
which last it is a source of constant annoyance, since
being a far less expert diver than the Canvasback, it
watches that bird until it rises with the highly-prized
root, and flies off with the stolen booty in triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Widgeon, like the Canvasback, can at times
be toled, as it is termed, or lured within gunshot of
sportsmen, concealed behind artificial screens of
reeds, built along the shore, or behind natural coverings,
such as brakes of cripple or reed-beds, by the
gambols of dogs taught to play and sport backward
and forward along the shore, for the purpose of attracting
the curious and fascinated wild fowl within
easy shooting distance. And strange to say, so
powerful is the attraction that the same flock of
ducks has been known to be decoyed into gunshot
thrice within the space of a single hour, above forty
birds being killed at the three discharges. Scaups,
or Blackheads, as they are called on the Chesapeake
tole, it is said, more readily than any other species,
and next to these the Canvasbacks and Redheads;
the Baldpates being the most cautious and wary of
them all, and rarely suffering themselves to be decoyed,
except when in company with the Canvasbacks,
along with which they swim shoreward
carelessly, though without appearing to notice the
dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These birds, with their congeners, are also shot
from points, as at Carrol’s Island, Abbey Island, Maxwell’s
Point, Legoe’s Point, and other places in the
same vicinity about the Bush and Gunpowder rivers,
while flying over high in air; and so great is the velocity
of their flight when going before the wind, and
such the allowance that must be made in shooting
ahead of them, that the very best of upland marksmen
are said to make very sorry work of it, until they become
accustomed to the flight of the wild fowl.
They are also shot occasionally in vast numbers at
holes in the ice which remain open when the rest
of the waters are frozen over; and yet again, by
means of swivel guns, carrying a pound of shot or
over, discharged from the bows of a boat, stealthily
paddled into the flocks at dead of night, when sleeping
in close columns on the surface of the water.
This method is, however, much reprobated by
sportsmen, and that very justly, as tending beyond
any other method to cause the fowl to desert their
feeding-grounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In conclusion, we earnestly recommend both these
beautiful birds to our sporting readers, both as objects
of pleasurable pursuit and subjects of first rate feeds.
A visit at this season to Seneca Lake, the Montezuma
Meadows, or that region, could not fail to yield rare
sport.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a most glorious afternoon! The air was
delightful. The sun shone with the softest splendor
upon the green cultivated meadow-land, divided into
square fields, each inclosed with its quick-set fence;
and within these, small farm-houses and cottages
with their gardens and vine-covered walls. It was
altogether a cheerful and lovely scene. Westward,
in the far distance, raised themselves the mist-covered
Welsh mountains. For the rest, the whole
adjacent country resembled that which I had hitherto
seen in England, softly undulating prairie. There
will come a time when the prairies of North America
will resemble this country. And the work has
already begun there in the square allotments, although
on a larger scale than here; the living fences, the
well-to-do farm-houses, they already look like birds’-nests
on the green billows; for already waves the
grass there with its glorious masses of flowers, over
immeasurable, untilled fields, and the sunflowers nod
and beckon in the breeze as if they said: “Come,—come,
ye children of men! The board is spread for
many!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The glorious flower-spread table, which can accommodate
two hundred and fifty millions of guests!
May it with its beauty one day unite more true happiness
than at this time the beautiful landscape of
England. For it is universally acknowledged, that
the agricultural districts of England are at this time
in a much more dubious condition than the manufacturing
districts, principally from the fact of the
large landed proprietors having, as it were, swallowed
up the small ones; and of the landed possession
being amassed in but few hands, who thus
cannot look after it excepting through paid stewards,
and this imperfectly. I heard of ten large landed
proprietors in a single family of but few individuals:
hence the number of small farmers who do not themselves
possess land, and who manage it badly, as
well as the congregating of laborers in houses and
cottages. The laws also for the possession of land
are so involved, and so full of difficulty, that they
throw impediments in the way of those who would
hold and cultivate it in much smaller lots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young barrister, Joseph Kay, has treated this
subject explicitly and fully, in his lately published
work “On the Social Condition and Education of
the People.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I, however, knew but little of this canker-worm
at the vitals of this beautiful portion of England, at
the time when I thus saw it, and therefore I enjoyed
my journey with undivided pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the evening, before sunset, I stood before Shakspeare’s
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It matters little being born in a poultry-yard, if
one only is hatched from a swan’s egg!” thought I,
in the words of Hans Christian Andersen, in his
story of “The Ugly Duckling,” when I beheld
the little, unsightly, half-timbered house in which
Shakspeare was born; and went through the low,
small rooms, up the narrow wooden stairs, which
were all that was left of the interior. It was empty
and poor, except in memory; the excellent little
old woman who showed the house, was the only
living thing there. I provided myself with some
small engravings having reference to Shakspeare’s
history, which she had to sell, and after that set forth
on a solitary journey of discovery to the banks of
the Avon; and before long, was pursuing a solitary
footpath which wound by the side of this beautiful
little river. To be all at once removed from the
thickly populated, noisy manufacturing towns into
that most lovely, most idyllic life, was in itself something
enchanting. Add to this the infinite deliciousness
of the evening; the pleasure of wandering thus
freely and alone in this neighborhood, with all its
rich memories; the deep calm that lay over all,
broken only by the twittering of the birds in the
bushes, and the cheerful voices of children at a
distance; the beautiful masses of trees, cattle grazing
in the meadows; the view of the proud Warwick
Castle, and near at hand the little town, the birthplace
of Shakspeare, and his grave, and above all,
the romantic stream, the bright Avon, which in its
calm winding course seemed, like its poet-swan—the
great Skald—to have no other object than faithfully
to reflect every object which mirrored itself in its
depths; castles, towns, churches, cottages, woods,
meadows, flowers, men, animals. This evening and
this river, and this solitary, beautiful ramble shall I
never forget, never! I spent no evening more beautiful
whilst in England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not until twilight settled down over the
landscape that I left the river-side. When I again
entered the little town, I was struck by its antique
character as well in the people as in the houses; it
seemed to me that the whole physiognomy of the
place belonged to the age of Shakspeare. Old men
with knee-breeches, old women in old-fashioned
caps, who with inquisitive and historical countenances,
furrowed by hundreds of wrinkles, now gazed
forth from their old projecting door-ways; thus must
they have stood, thus must they have gazed when
Shakspeare wandered here; and he, the black-garmented,
hump-backed old man who looked so kind,
so original and so learned, just like an ancient
chronicle, and who saluted me, the stranger, as
people are not in the habit of doing now-a-days—he
must certainly be some old rector magnificus who
has returned to earth from the sixteenth century.
Whilst I was thus dreaming myself back again into
the times of old, a sight met my eyes which transported
me five thousand miles across the ocean, to
the poetical wilderness of the new world. This
was a full-blown magnolia-flower, just like a magnolia
grandiflora, and here blossomed on the walls
of an elegant little house, the whole of whose front
was adorned by the branches and leaves of a magnolia
reptans, a species with which I was not yet
acquainted. I hailed with joy the beautiful flower
which I had not seen since I had wandered in the
magnolia groves of Florida, on the banks of the
Welaka, (St. John,) and drank the morning dew as
solitary as now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every thing in that little town was, for the rest,
<span class='it'>à la Shakspeare</span>. One saw on all sides little statues
of Shakspeare, some white, others gilt—half-length
figures—and very much resembling idol images.
One saw Shakspeare-books, Shakspeare-music, Shakspeare-engravings,
Shakspeare articles of all kinds.
In one place I even saw <span class='it'>Shakspeare-sauce</span> announced;
but that did not take my fancy, as I feared
it might be too strong for my palate. True, one saw
at the same place an announcement of <span class='it'>Jenny Lind-drops</span>,
and that did take my fancy very much, for as
a Swede, I was well pleased to see the beautiful
fame of the Swedish singer recognized in Shakspeare’s
town, and having a place by the side of his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arrived at my inn, close to Shakspeare’s house: I
drank tea; was waited upon by an agreeable girl,
Lucy, and passed a good night in a chamber which
bore the superscription “Richard the Third.” I
should have preferred as a bed-room “The Midsummer
Night’s Dream,” a room within my chamber,
only that it was not so good, and Richard the Third
did me no harm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wandered again on the banks of the Avon on the
following morning, and from a height beheld that
cheerful neighborhood beneath the light of the morning
sun. After this I visited the church in which
were interred Shakspeare and his daughter Susanna.
A young bridal couple were just coming out of
church after having been married, the bride dressed
in white and veiled, so that I could not see her features
distinctly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The epitaph on Shakspeare’s grave, composed by
himself, is universally known, with its strong concluding
lines—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Blessed be the man that spares these stones,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;And cursed be he that moves my bones.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Less generally known is the inscription on the
tomb of his daughter Susanna, which highly praises
her virtues and her uncommon wit, and which seems
to regard Shakspeare as happy for having such a
daughter. I thought that Susanna Shakspeare ought
to have been proud of her father. I have known
young girls to be proud of their fathers—the most
beautiful pride which I can conceive, because it is full
of humble love. And how well it became them!</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the rest, it was not as a fanatical worshiper of
Shakspeare that I wandered through the scene of his
birth and his grave. I owe much to this great
dramatist; he has done much for me, but—not in the
highest degree. I know of nobler grouping, loftier
characters and scenes, in especial a greater drama
of life than any which he has represented, and particularly
a higher degree of harmony than he has
given; and as I wandered on the banks of the Avon,
I seemed to perceive the approach of a new Shakspeare,
the new poet of the age, to the boards of the
world’s stage; the poet who shall comprehend within
the range of his vision all parts of the earth, all races
of men, all regions of nature—the palms of the tropics,
the crystal palaces of the polar circle—and
present them all in a new drama, in the large expression
and the illuminating light of a vast human
intelligence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shakspeare, great as he is, is to me, nevertheless,
only a Titanic greatness, an intellectual giant-nature,
who stands amid inexplicable dissonance. He
drowns Ophelia, and puts out the eyes of the noble
Kent, and leaves them and us to our darkness. That
which I long for, that which I hope for, is a poet
who will rise above dissonances, a harmonious nature
who will regard the drama of the world with
the eye of Deity; in a word, a Shakspeare who will
resemble a—Beethoven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On my way from Stratford to Leamington I stopped
at Warwick Castle, one of the few old castles of
the middle ages in England which still remain well-preserved,
and which are still inhabited by the old
hereditary families. The old Earl of Warwick resides
now quite alone in his splendid castle, his wife
having been dead about six months. Two days in
the week he allows his castle to be thrown open for
a few hours for the gratification of the curiosity of
strangers. It is in truth a magnificent castle, with
its fortress-tower and its lofty gray stone walls, surrounded
by a beautiful park, and gloriously situated
on the banks of the Avon—magnificent, and romantically
beautiful at the same time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the rooms prevailed princely splendor, and there
were a number of good pictures, those of Vandyke
in particular. I remarked several portraits of Charles
the First, with his cold, gloomy features; several
also of the lovely but weak Henrietta Maria; one of
Cromwell, a strong countenance, but without nobility;
one of Alba, with an expression harder than
flint-stone—a petrified nature; and one of Shakspeare,
as Shakspeare might have appeared, with an
eye full of intense thought, a broad forehead, a countenance
elaborated and tempered in the fires of strong
emotion; not in the least resembling that fat, jolly,
aldermanic head usually represented as Shakspeare’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rooms contained many works of art, and from
the windows what glorious views! In truth, thought
I, it is pardonable if the proprietor of such a castle,
inherited from brave forefathers, and living in the
midst of scenes rich in great memories, with which
the history of his family is connected—it is pardonable
if such a man is proud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There he goes!—the Earl!” said the man who
was showing me through the rooms; and, looking
through a window into the castle-court, I saw a tall,
very thin figure, with white hair, and dressed in
black, walking slowly, with head bent forward,
across the grass-plot in the middle of the court.
That was the possessor of this proud mansion, the
old Earl of Warwick!</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Parhelia.</span> Mock suns, in the vicinity
of the real orb, are due to the same cause
as haloes, which appear in connection with
them. Luminous circles, or segments, crossing
one another, produce conspicuous masses
of light by their united intensities, and the
points of intersection appear studded with
the solar image. This is a meteorological
rarity in our latitude, but a very frequent
spectacle in the arctic climes. In Iceland,
during the severe winter of 1615, it is related
that the sun, when seen, was always
accompanied by two, four, five, and even
nine of these illusions. Captain Parry describes
a remarkably gorgeous appearance,
during his winter sojourn at Melville Island,
which continued from noon until six o’clock
in the evening. It consisted of one complete
halo, 45° in diameter, with segments
of several others, displaying in parts the colors of the
rainbow. Besides these, there was another perfect
ring of a pale white color, which went right round
the sky, parallel with the horizon, and at a distance
from it equal to the sun’s altitude; and a horizontal
band of white light appeared passing through the sun.
Where the band and the inner halo cut each other,
there were two parhelia, and another close to the
horizon, directly under the sun, which formed the
most brilliant part of the spectacle, being exactly like
the sun, slightly obscured by a thin cloud at his
rising or setting. A drawing of this parhelion is
given by Captain Parry, who remarks upon having
always observed such phenomena attended with a
little snow falling, or rather small spicula or fine
crystals of ice. The angular forms of the crystals
determine the rays of light in different directions,
and originate the consequent visual variety. We
have various observations of parhelia seen in different
parts of Europe, which in a less enlightened age excited
consternation, and were regarded as portentous.
Matthew Paris relates in his history:—“A wonderful
sight was seen in England, A. D. 1233, April 8, in
the fifth year of the reign of Henry III., and lasted
from sunrise till noon. At the same time on the 8th
of April, about one o’clock, in the borders of Herefordshire
and Worcestershire, besides the true sun,
there appeared in the sky four mock suns of a red
color; also a certain large circle of the color of crystal,
about two feet broad, which encompassed all
England as it were. There went out semicircles
from the side of it, at whose intersection the four
mock suns were situated, the true sun being in the
east, and the air very clear. And because this monstrous
prodigy cannot be described by words, I have
represented it by a scheme, which shows immediately
how the heavens were circled. The appearance
was painted in this manner by many people,
for the wonderful novelty of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Paraselenæ.</span> Mock moons, depending upon the
causes which produce the solar image, or several
examples of it, as frequently adorn the arctic sky.
On the 1st of December, 1819, in the evening, while
Parry’s expedition was in Winter Harbor, four paraselenæ
were observed, each at the distance of 21½°
from the true moon. One was close to the horizon,
the other perpendicular above it, and the other two
in a line parallel to the horizon. Their shape was
like that of a comet, the tail being from the moon,
the side of each toward the real orb being of a light
orange color. During the existence of these paraselenæ,
a halo appeared in a concentric circle round
the moon, passing through each image. On the
evening of March 30, 1820, about ten o’clock, the
attention of Dr. Trail, at Liverpool, was directed by
a friend to an unusual appearance in the sky, which
proved to be a beautiful display of paraselenæ. The
moon was then 35° above the southern horizon. The
atmosphere was nearly calm, but rather cloudy, and
obscured by a slight haze. A wide halo, faintly exhibiting
the prismatic colors, was described round
the moon as a centre, and had a small portion of its
circumference cut off by the horizon. The circular
band was intersected by two small segments of a
larger circle, which if completed would have passed
through the moon, and parallel to the horizon. These
segments were of a paler color than the first mentioned
circle. At the points of intersection appeared
two pretty well defined luminous discs, equaling the
moon in size, but less brilliant. The western paraselenæ
had a tail or coma, which was directed from
the moon, and the eastern also, but less clearly-defined.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The Rainbow.</span> The most glorious vision depending
upon the decomposition, refraction, and reflection
of light, by the vapor of the atmosphere reduced
to fluid drops, is the well-known arch projected during
a shower of rain upon a cloud opposite to the sun,
displaying all the tints of the solar spectrum. The
first marked approximation to the true theory of the
rainbow occurs in a volume entitled <span class='it'>De Radiis Visus
et Lucis</span>, written by Antonius de Dominis, Archbishop
of Spalatro, published in the year 1611 at
Venice. Descartes pursued the subject, and correctly
explained some of the phenomena; but upon Newton’s
discovery of the different degrees of refrangibility
in the different colored rays which compose
the sunbeam, a pencil of white or compounded light,
the cause of the colored bands in the rainbow, of the
order of their position, and of the breadth they occupy,
was at once apparent. The bow is common
to all countries, and is the sign of the covenant of
promise to all people, that there shall no more be
such a wide-spread deluge as that which the sacred
narrative records.</p>

<p class='line0'>Distended, as the brow of God appeased?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is happily remarked by Mr. Prout, in his Bridgewater
Treatise, that no pledge could have been more
felicitous or satisfactory; for, in order that the rainbow
may appear, the clouds must be <span class='it'>partial</span>, and
hence its existence is absolutely incompatible with
<span class='it'>universal</span> deluge from above. So long, therefore,
as “He doth set his bow in the clouds,” so long have
we full assurance that these clouds must continue to
shower down good, and not evil, to the earth.</p>

<p class='caption'><span class='bold'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Rainbow.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>When rain is falling, and the sun is on the horizon,
the bow appears a complete semicircle, if the rain-cloud
is sufficiently extensive to display it. Its extent
diminishes as the solar altitude increases, because
the colored arch is a portion of a circle whose centre
is a point in the sky directly opposite to the sun.
Above the height of 45° the primary bow is invisible,
and hence, in our climate, the rainbow is not seen in
summer about the middle of the day. In peculiar
positions a complete circle may be beheld, as when
the shower is on a mountain, and the spectator in a
valley; or when viewed from the top of a lofty pinnacle,
nearly the whole circumference may sometimes
be embraced. Ulloa and Bouguer describe
circular rainbows, frequently seen on the mountains,
which rise above the table-land of Quito. When rain
is abundant, there is a secondary bow distinctly seen,
produced by a double reflection. This is exterior to
the primary one, and the intervening space has been
observed to be occupied by an arch of colored light.
The secondary bow differs from the other, in exhibiting
the same series of colors in an inverted order.
Thus the red is the uppermost color in the interior
bow, and the violet in the exterior. A tertiary bow
may exist, but it is so exceedingly faint from the repeated
reflections, as to be scarcely ever perceptible.
The same lovely spectacle may be seen when the
solar splendor falls upon the spray of the cataract and
the waves, the shower of an artificial fountain, and
the dew upon the grass. There is hardly any other
object of nature more pleasing to the eye, or soothing
to the mind, than the rainbow, when distinctly developed—a
familiar sight in all regions, but most
common in mountainous districts, where the showers
are most frequent. Poetry has celebrated its beauty,
and to convey an adequate representation of its soft
and variegated tints, is the highest achievement of
the painter’s art. While the Hebrews called it the
Bow of God, on account of its association with a
divine promise, and the Greeks the Daughter of
Wonder, the rude inhabitants of the
North gave expression to a fancy which
its peculiar aspect might well create,
styling it the Bridge of the Gods, a
passage connecting heaven and earth.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The principles which account for
the formation of the rainbow explain
the appearance of beautiful irridescent
arches which have occasionally been
observed during the prevalence of mist
and sunshine. Mr. Cochin describes
a spectacle of this kind, noticed from
an eminence that overlooked some low
meadow-grounds, in a direction opposite
to that of the sun, which was
shining very brightly, a thick mist resting
upon the landscape in front. At
about the distance of half a mile from
each other, and incurvated, like the
lower extremities of the common rainbow,
two places of peculiar brightness
were seen in the mist. They seemed
to rest on the ground, were continued
as high as the fog extended, the breadth
being nearly half as much more as that
of the rainbow. In the middle between
these two places, and on the same
horizontal line, there was a colored
appearance, whose base subtended an angle of about 12°, and whose interior
parts were thus variegated. The centre was dark, as if made by
the shadow of some object resembling in size and shape an ordinary sheaf
of corn. Next this centre there was a curved space of a yellow flame
color. To this succeeded another curved space of nearly the same dark
cast as the centre, very evenly bounded on each side, and tinged with a
faint blue green. The exterior exhibited a rainbow circlet, only its tints
were less vivid, their boundaries were not so well defined, and the
whole, instead of forming part of a perfect circle, appeared like the end
of a concentric ellipsis, whose transverse axis was perpendicular to the
horizon. The mist lay thick upon the surface of the meadows; the observer
was standing near its margin, and gradually the scene became
fainter, and faded away, as he entered into it. A
similar fog-bow was seen by Captain Parry during
his attempt to reach the North Pole by means of
boats and sledges, with five arches formed within the
main one, and all beautifully colored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The iris lunaris, or lunar rainbow, is a much rarer
object than the solar one. It frequently consists of a
uniformly white arch, but it has often been seen tinted,
the colors differing only in intensity from those caused
by the direct solar illuminations. Aristotle states that
he was the first observer of this interesting spectacle,
and that he only saw two in the course of fifty
years; but it must have been repeatedly witnessed,
without a record having been made of the fact.
Thoresby relates an account received from a friend, of
an observation of the bow fixed by the moon in the
clouds, while traveling in the Peak of Derbyshire. She
had then passed the full about twenty-four hours. The
evening had been rainy, but the clouds had dispersed,
and the moon was shining very clearly. This lunar
iris was more remarkable than that observed by Dr.
Plot, of which there is an account in his History of
Oxford, that being only of a white color, but this had
all the hues of the solar rainbow, beautiful and distinct,
but fainter. Mr. Bucke remarks upon having
had the good fortune to witness several, two of which
were perhaps as fine as were ever witnessed in any
country. The first formed an arch over the vale of
Usk. The moon hung over the Blorenge; a dark
cloud was suspended over Myarth; the river murmured
over beds of stones, and a bow, illumined by
the moon, stretched from one side of the vale to another.
The second was seen from the castle overlooking
the Bay of Carmarthen, forming a regular
semicircle over the river Towy. It was in a moment
of vicissitude; and the fancy of the observer
willingly reverted to the various soothing associations
under which sacred authority unfolds the
emblem and sign of a merciful covenant vouchsafed
by a beneficent Creator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emphatically is this, the nineteenth century, the
age of intellectuality. Never before has mind exercised
such direct, positive and appreciable influence
as it now does; for never before, in the history of
the world, has there existed such an amount of mental
cultivation, of general education, of desire for
moral improvement, as is now manifested throughout
the entire extent of the civilized globe. Spiritual
trains, as it were, are ready laid in every direction;
and those minds endowed by the Creator with the
fire of genius, that electrical energy which <span class='it'>will</span> find
vent, enkindle those trains, and at once produce excitement,
commotion, action, in the myriad magazines
of thought to which they lead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The days of brute force are amongst the things
that were; engulfed by the irresistible, ever-advancing
ocean of time, they are only remembered among
the legends of the barbarous Past. Intellect rules
the world—words are recognized as things—men are
venerated in proportion to the amount of mind, soul
and spirit they possess: in the ratio of the manifestation
of their diviner essence—and not for those
qualities, merely physical or adventitious, which
make them of kin to the brutes that perish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing, therefore, is more eagerly sought after by
the public, than biographical sketches and portraits
of those favored children of nature who are recognized
as the possessors of this inestimable inheritance—mind;
this priceless treasure—genius. Consequently,
we feel assured, that the following brief
sketch of one of the most powerful and popular
writers of the day, of one, who, descended from a
line of talented and patriotic ancestors, has inherited
their distinguishing characteristics—stern integrity
of purpose, indomitable energy, untiring industry and
brilliant genius in an eminent degree—and who,
though yet in the first flush of manhood, has already
achieved a name and earned a reputation, of which
even the aged might be proud—will be gladly perused
by the readers of <span class='sc'>Graham</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Samuel Godman, the paternal grandfather
of Stewart A. Godman, was born and educated in
Virginia; he was the son of a planter who was by
marriage the uncle of Thomas Jefferson. He married,
soon after he had attained his majority, and removed
to the city of Baltimore, Maryland, where he
engaged extensively in the shipping and tobacco business;
at that time the heaviest and most lucrative
traffic of the place. Here he remained several years,
and having accumulated quite a handsome fortune,
he removed to the city of Annapolis, where he resided
until his death, in <a id='cap1'></a>1795. At the breaking out
of the Revolutionary struggle, Captain Godman,
promptly and with characteristic energy espoused
the cause of liberty, and with the assistance of his
two brothers, at once raised a company of which he
was unanimously elected captain, and tendered their
services to his suffering country. This company was
gladly accepted, and formed a part of the well-known
regiment of the “Maryland Line,” which upheld the
honor of the struggling colonies and covered itself
with so much glory throughout our ever memorable
contest for Independence. During the whole war
was Captain Godman true to his responsibility,
sharing in every battle in which his regiment took
part, and making a liberal use of his private means
in supplying the necessities of his command. At
the memorable battle of the Cowpens, in Spartanburg
district, South Carolina, he was severely
wounded, by a musket ball, in the leg, which disabled
him for awhile; but he soon, even before the
wound had healed, resumed his post at the head of
his company, and continued with them until peace
was declared, the end had been accomplished and
his beloved land was free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John D. Godman, M. D., the father of Stewart,
was born at Annapolis in <a id='cap2'></a>1796. Before he was two
years of age he had the misfortune to lose both of his
parents, and was subsequently defrauded by his father’s
executor of his inheritance; thus was he
thrown, at an early age, entirely upon his own resources.
He also, while yet a boy, served his country:
being on board the flotilla during the bombardment
of Fort McHenry by the British, in the war
of 1812. At the close of the war he commenced the
study of medicine. As a student, he was diligent,
energetic and persevering, and as an evidence of his
proficiency and distinguished attainments, he was
called to the chair of Anatomy in the University of
Maryland (vacated by an accident to the Professor.)
and for several weeks before he graduated, filled this
situation with so much propriety as to gain universal
applause. After his graduation, he entered upon the
active duties of his profession with the same energy
and diligence which had distinguished him while a
pupil. He filled the chair of Anatomy in the Medical
College of Ohio, and subsequently, in 1826, was
called to the same chair in Rutger’s Medical College
in the city of New York. In these situations he acquired
a popularity almost unparalleled. But his
professional duties, together with his other scientific
pursuits, proved too arduous, in that climate, for a
constitution already subdued by labor and broken
by disease, and he was compelled to seek a more
genial clime. From this time his disease steadily
progressed, so as to leave no hope for his final recovery,
but he still continued to labor in the field of
Science and Literature almost to the last week of his
life. He died in the thirty-fourth year of his age.
The following merited tribute to the memory of Dr.
Godman, we take from an address delivered on that
occasion before the Medical Faculty and Students
of Columbian College.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There has recently appeared among us a man so
remarkable for the character of his mind, and the
qualities of his heart—one whose life, though short,
was attended with such brilliant displays of genius,
with such distinguished success in the study of our
profession and the kindred sciences, that to pass him
by without tracing the history of his career, and
placing before you the prominent traits of his character,
as exhibited in the important events of his
life, would alike be on act of injustice to the memory
of eminent worth, and deprive you of one of the noblest
examples of the age.” To specify the numerous
and admired productions of Dr. Godman would
occupy too much of our limited space, but they have
been before the public for a considerable time, and
have been received with high approbation, and
several have been republished in foreign countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mother of S. A. Godman was the second
daughter of Rembrant Peale, Esq., the celebrated
artist—who, still living, is the oldest and the best
painter of whom America can boast—his splendid
allegorical painting of “The Court of Death,” and his
admirable likeness of Washington, painted from an
original portrait taken by him of the Father of his
Country, which hangs over the Vice-President’s
seat in the United States’ Senate Chamber—are familiar
to thousands of your readers. Mrs. Godman
is a remarkable woman—possessing all the amiable
traits that most adorn the gentler sex, combined with
an amount of energy and decision of mind seldom to
be met with—both developed and improved by a
thorough course of education in a celebrated seminary
abroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Godman left three children, then too young to
appreciate the full extent of their loss—one, a daughter,
now married to Dr. W. W. Goldsmith, of Kentucky,
is a most gifted and lovely lady; the others
were boys, the elder of whom is the subject of the
present sketch—the other, Harry R. Godman, M. D.,
is already known to the reading public, and by the
purity and depth of feeling, expressed with so much
ease and beauty in his writings, is winning for himself,
surely and deservedly, a reputation as one of
the best of the younger poets of our country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stewart A. Godman was born in Cincinnati, Sept.
8th, 1822, a few weeks before his father resigned
his professorship in the Medical College of Ohio;
and at the early age of six weeks he commenced his
wanderings—being carried by his parents to the city
of Baltimore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It appears to be a provision of nature, and it is
doubtless a wise one, that, no matter what may be
the surrounding circumstances, every man destined
to produce an impression upon his fellows, and to
leave his “footprints on the sands of time,” must, in
his earlier years, encounter a series of changes and
difficulties, preparing him, as it were perforce, for
the position he is to occupy. The inborn, inherent
energy that is in them, produces a restlessness and a
desire for something, they know not what, that keeps
them ever shifting from purpose and pursuit, until at
last they find the field and make the opening in
which they are fitted to shine. This want of stability,
as it seems, and dislike to plod along contentedly
in whatever road circumstances have placed
them, subjects them oftentimes to the charge of
fickleness, and it is only when they have found their
natural sphere—and true genius ever will force a
path to its legitimate position—is it admitted by
lookers-on that it was the resistless cravings of the
governing, controlling spirit eagerly seeking its own,
that actuated them—instead of fickleness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This fate was not escaped by young Godman, for,
although still comparatively a young man, he has
experienced vicissitudes, changes and trials—mental,
physical and pecuniary—greater than most persons
have to encounter who live to the allotted age of
three score years and ten. Naturally of an energetic
and bold disposition, averse to restraint, and
deprived at the early age of eight years, by death, of
his father—a loss in any case so great, but in his,
with such a parent, how irreparable—his life has
been checkered by the changing phases that ever accompany
the life-struggle of each man who strives
to attain an eminent position by paths novel and self-suggested.
Blessed in an unusual degree with friends,
able, willing, indeed anxious, to assist him, he would
have had only to follow either of the many openings
and advantages that were freely tendered, to have
attained certain wealth and station at an early age.
The natural independence of his character, however,
combined with his strong innate feeling of self-reliance,
caused him to undervalue and neglect the
many easy roads to success, that by the influence of
his father’s numerous friends and admirers were offered—and
to prefer the more hazardous and difficult
plan of carving out his own road, of being the architect
of his own fortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His primary education was most thorough; for
quick, keen, inquiring and industrious, and having the
very best instructors, he made rapid progress in every
branch. At a very early age, when the brilliancy
of his mind and the promise he gave of doing credit
to his preceptors were already apparent, anxious to
mingle in the real bustle and business of life, he determined
to leave school. At this time he was at
the Baltimore College, then under the charge of that
finished scholar and accomplished gentleman, John
Prentiss, Esq., and despite the persuasions of his
friends and teachers he persisted in his determination.
Removing then from Baltimore to Philadelphia, he
entered the large establishment of that well-known
merchant, David S. Brown, Esq., where he remained
for three years, and earned a reputation for business
tact and ability such as is seldom awarded a youth
of his years. Not finding in the details of commerce
that mental satisfaction he sought, and unheeding altogether
the unusually advantageous prospects before
him, much against the advice of Mr. Brown, he resolved
to try the profession of medicine. Returning
to Baltimore, to which place he was invited by Dr.
R. S. Stewart (after whom he was named) then one
of the largest practitioners in the Monumental City,
but now retired with an ample fortune—he attended
one course of lectures at the University of Maryland.
Here he stood first among his classmates—but
disgusted with the details of hospital practice, at
the end of the first winter he found that medicine
was not the path he wished to pursue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His uncle, Thomas Jefferson Godman, residing in
Madison, Indiana, was anxious to have young Godman
study law, and at his earnest solicitation he
went to Madison, and entered as a student the office
of the Hon. Jesse D. Bright, now United States
Senator. Law, however, was not more congenial
to his spirit than medicine; and after three months
hard study, he threw aside Blackstone, Chitty, and
their compeers, and applied for admittance into the
United States Navy, as a midshipman. Although,
at the time of his application, which was made directly
to the President, there was a very large number
of applicants on record for warrants, young
Godman received his at once—“in consideration,”
as was written in the letter containing the warrant,
“of the distinguished services of his grandfather
during the Revolution,” and for which neither pension
nor remuneration had ever been asked. Only
about eighteen months did Godman remain in the
navy; at first the glitter, pomp, and excitement of
the service pleased, but he soon found that it was
no place to rise—for time, not merit, graduated promotion—so
quitting the navy, he entered the merchant
service, and after making a couple of short
voyages, he returned home. His friends, fearful
that he would never settle down to regular business,
opposed his again going to sea, and persuaded him
to re-enter the mercantile business. He then determined
to go to Charleston, where, through the
influence of a distinguished friend of his father, Dr.
E. Geddings, he at once obtained a situation in one
of the largest stores in the city. He remained there
some eight months, when his independent spirit having
been wounded, in consequence of some misunderstanding
with his employer, about a leave of
absence during the holydays, he relinquished his
situation, and again went to sea, as mate of a merchantman.
A wanderer, did he thus continue, until
almost twenty-one, when an accident, seemingly the
most trivial, changed the entire course of his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had just returned to Charleston from a voyage,
and had fully determined, having made all his arrangements,
to go to China and settle among the inhabitants
of the Celestial Empire, when the suggestion
of a casual acquaintance caused him to reflect
seriously upon the manner in which he was
squandering his life and talents; and he at once determined
to go into the country for a couple of years,
and in the quiet of rural life, to settle his mind, and
chalk out a course for the future. Acting upon this
resolution, he went to Abbeville District, South
Carolina, where, as money was not his object,
further than as a means of subsistence for the present,
he took a situation in a country store. Whilst
here, he became acquainted with and attached to
Miss A. R. Gillam, to whom, before he was twenty-two,
he was united in marriage. This event necessarily
brought about a change in his plans, and induced
him to remain in the up-country of South
Carolina. His wife died about two years after their
union. In 1848 he married Miss M. E. Watts, of
Laurens District. A short time previous to this
marriage, Godman bought the Laurensville Herald—a
small country paper, having only three hundred
and fifty subscribers. To this he devoted all his
energies, and after having made for it an enviable reputation,
he sold it at the expiration of a little more
than two years with a subscription list of nearly two
thousand. Seeing the necessity that existed for a
Southern Literary Newspaper of high standing, he
last fall determined to establish such a journal; and
the great success and universal popularity of the
paper which he is now publishing, “The Illustrated
Family Friend,” clearly attests the tact, talent,
energy and business qualifications of its editor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inheriting the brilliant parts of his father, from his
temperament necessarily a hard student and deep
thinker, with all the advantages that an extensive
and thorough knowledge of the world, which a
keen, inquiring, analytical mind must acquire, from
close communion with mankind under almost every
phase of life—the unexampled success and universal
popularity that has been obtained by Godman, as a
writer, are not astonishing, though they are remarkable.
Philosophic imagination, vividness of conception,
energy, and a conscientious endeavor to
make all that he does tend to some practical and
useful purpose, are his distinguishing mental traits.
Although he writes rapidly, his style is easy, graceful,
natural, whilst at the same time, it is always bold,
vigorous, original, and worthy of all commendation
for its elevated moral tone. Should his life be spared,
we are certain that he will win for himself a reputation
second to no author of whom America can
boast; for already, since the demise of the lamented
Cooper, he has attained the enviable distinction of
being one of the best, if not the best writer of Nautical
Romances now living.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Socially, Stewart A. Godman enjoys an unusual
degree of personal popularity, and is respected and
esteemed by all who know him; in his deportment
he is affable and polite to all; in conversation fluent,
though unstudied. With a mind stocked with a vast
fund of anecdote, and a vivid imagination to point
the varied scenes through which he has passed, he
is always listened to with interest, while at the same
time he imparts knowledge to his friends, who
esteem it a privilege to cluster around him in his

<h2 class='nobreak'>WHAT DANDIES DO.</h2>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i040.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0010' style='width:70%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Fops differ from scare-crows in this particular—the
latter guard the young blades of green things by
the appearance of their apparel alone; but dandies
are themselves young blades and green things, and
are not stationary effigies, but moving frights. They
are not stuffed figures which stand still, but empty
semblances which perigrinate. They are defective
verbs, which “do” and “suffer,” it is true, but are
only used in certain moods and tenses: <span class='it'>to wit</span>, the
indicative mood, and imperfect tense—indicating that
such things are, and are not worth much. This
etymological fact establishes that dandies do something,
and having settled into that conviction, it becomes
necessary to inquire with great gravity, what
do they do?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will not require an overwhelming quantum of
credulity to lead the reader to a belief that nothing
of much importance has ever been done by an exquisite.
He neither adds to the character or the
utility of society. He aids not in commerce or
manufactures—except, perhaps, as a buyer of coats
and kid gloves—being, as to those things, a consumer,
whether profitably so or not to the artist in cloth
and professor of gloving, a narrow inspection of their
ledgers will only answer satisfactorily. He is not
what political economists call a producer, unless
the labor he bestows upon cultivating his moustache,
may entitle him to a place among the “sons of toil.”
He adds nothing to the general wealth; although he
extravagantly expends the money which he borrowed
from a rich friend, or that which his kind grandfather,
the tavern-keeper, bequeathed him when he
left off selling common brandy, and went to “a
world of pure spirits.” Except to “point a moral,
or adorn a tale,” the fop is therefore not useful. He
is, like vice,</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;——A monster of such hideous mien,</p>
<p class='line0'>That to be hated needs but to be seen;</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>but we trust that the further remarks of the poet, in
regard to familiarity of face, will not apply to the
dandy, though many of that tribe who saunter along
Chestnut street have faces extremely familiar. If
a herd of bucks were interrogated as to their own
opinions of their positions in society, it is probable
that they would assign themselves to the ornamental
department. But on that subject a very lively debate
might be held, and if it were at length decided
that they were decorations to the “solidarity of the
peoples,” their relative situation would be like gold
leaf on gingerbread; extremely gaudy, to be sure,
but very unwholesome to swallow. They are ugly
ornaments, like odd figures upon Indian temples,
serving no purpose but to mislead the veneration of
those who ignorantly worship at the shrine. They
are like copper rings in Choctaw noses, ungraceful
extras upon the face of nature, and of no intrinsic
value. There can only be one point of view in
which a buck may be looked at in a useful light, and
that is as an object to be laughed at.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a late number of <span class='sc'>Graham</span> we devoted some
space to an elucidation of the question, “How are
dandies made?” and having said sufficient upon that
topic, we pass to a notice of their doings. A prompt
and significant period might be put to these lucubrations,
by the averment that dandies do “an infinite
deal of nothing,” but that would not be literally true,
for although their actions are of no public importance,
still those who write their biographies will
be compelled to admit that they do something. Ease
is but a word which signifies a comparative release
from labor; idleness is but the definition of a state of
unprofitable action. Those who have nothing to do
cannot exist without doing something; and he who
has much time on his hands is compelled to employ
it in some pursuit to escape from the horror of positive
<span class='it'>ennui</span>. Therefore, even dandies, those cob-webs
of society, catch flies when the unwary insects
come into the meshes of their webs, and at times put
themselves to great inconvenience and fatigue, whilst
enjoying the felicity of their <span class='it'>otium cum dignitate</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But how does the exquisite spend his hours? It
may be safely asserted that midnight very often passes
before he seeks his bed, after the fatigues of the
day and night—and that the sun has mounted high
in the meridian before he awakes from slumbers
which are not refreshing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as he endeavors to costume himself in the
fifth story room of some fashionable boarding-house,
he finds himself environed with difficulties. On a
winter morning he will get out of his bed shivering,
and find all his toilet arrangements deranged by frost.
His water will probably be frozen in his pitcher, and
scarcely disposed to yield to the endearing demonstration
of his gold-headed cane. His landlady may
wait upon him to assure him that his stockings and
drawers, which were washed on the previous night,
are frozen stiff, and that she has not had time to properly
dry and iron them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This will be sad news, indeed; for although your
true dandy riots in coats and variety of apparel
which the world can see, he is generally rather short
in those articles which every one is presumed to have,
but which are not visible to the public eye. Perhaps
the freezing of the indispensables which the
landlady brings him may put him to serious inconvenience.
If so, it must be borne. That will not
be the least of his troubles. The necessity of being
particular about his whiskers, is by no means the
greatest of the cares which annoy him. Hours are
daily spent in the study of neck-cloths, the experimental
philosophy of dress-coats, the spindleizing of
thin legs, and the tightening of pantaloons. Those
are home employments to which it is only necessary
to allude. The real business of the day commences
when the fop, about twelve o’clock, emerges for a
walk on the south side of Chestnut street. Here he
is noted for those particularities of dress which are
his own glory, and “the badge of all his tribe.”
Perhaps he meets one of his associates, and arm-in-arm
they mince their way along, talking of Miss
So-and-so’s party, or the “insufferable stupidity”
of some who have not as many coats as themselves;
simpering and twaddling, thus their movements
may be varied by manœuvres which are indescribably
odd. The unmeaning faces which have for
some time been expressive of nothing but inanity,
will suddenly become o’erspread with an appearance
of semi-consciousness, as some dashing belle approaches.
By a movement simultaneous and sudden,
both exquisites will make a jerking bend of the
body from the hips upward—their right hands will
be raised to their hats; by the time the lady has
passed them, and proceeded six feet in the opposite
direction, their beavers will be lifted from their
noddles at least twelve inches, held extended a moment,
and by the time the belle is twenty feet off,
returned to the craniums on which they rested, and
the delighted couple pass onward, supposing they
have made genteel bows. None but those who have
seen a first-rate fop publicly salute a lady of his acquaintance,
can have an idea of the ludicrous character
of his movements, and the comical nature of
the entire manœuvre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the twain at length, tire of their promenade
and adjourn to some fashionable drinking saloon for
a “whiskey skin,” or a “brandy plain.” Still they
must have amusement, and they accordingly determine
to try their skill at billiards—a gentlemanly
game, which will not fatigue their weak muscles
or agitate their delicate nerves. The mysteries of
this diversion, like the oddities of backgammon, are
well calculated to puzzle the uninformed mind. It
would, perhaps, be irreverent to compare it to
marbles, that fascination of youth, yet it resembles
it much, though sooth to say, it is not as readily understood
by the unlearned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Judging from appearances, billiards is a game in
which the endeavor of the player is to cause certain
ivory balls to hit other balls “back-handed licks.”
With a thin rod of wood, the player is constantly
going through strange gymnastics. Sometimes he
endeavors to strike one spheroid against another.
At other times he propels his ivory plaything in
such a manner, that it does nothing but fly from side
to side of a table enclosed by a padded rim, without
producing any visible effect whatever. Occasionally
the great object seems to be to push a ball
against which mischief is evidently meditated, into
a bag, or pocket, some of which are ambushed in
the corners, and others in the center of the rim of
the table. Then, again, the player does not seem
to care a half-penny for this triumph, though within
his power, but rather seeks to make one ball strike
another, which flies off at a tangent, hits another,
and then in backing out from the concussion, touches
one of the balls already struck. Whilst all this is
going on—an attendant is constantly meddling with
a frame of rods above the table, on which are strung
white and black wooden beads. Occasionally all
the beads are moved one way, then some of them
are shifted to the place from which they were removed.
The spectator in vain endeavors to ascertain
the nature of the game. All that he can tell
about it is, that the players bend over the table with
scientific calculation, and throw themselves into
many strange attitudes whilst considering how much
force is necessary to make one ball strike another,
or to cause a series of shocks among all which are
upon the table. When it is all over, and the cues
are returned to the rack, Blessed Ignorance leaves
the billiard-saloon, satisfied that somebody has won
the game; but why, or how, it is impossible for him
to determine, inasmuch as the whole business seems
to be a very grave and solemn mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In these ceremonies fops delight, and it is pleasant
to hear them boast of their triumphs, in tones which
should characterize important achievements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The afternoon promenade in Chestnut street, upon
fine afternoons—when belledom is abroad—is one of
the principal occupations of the dandy. There he is
preëminent for the instability of his legs, the absurdity
of his over-coat, the glossiness of his hat, (the
dandy <span class='it'>pure et simple</span>, does not affect the Kossuth
slouch,) the surprising appearance of his shirt-collar,
his cravat-tie <span class='it'>comme il faut</span>; his kid gloves—which
just now are of a bright green color; his light cane,
the head of which is an ivory facsimile in little of
an opera-dancer’s leg—and his very noticeable beard
and moustache. Glorying in his appearance, conceiting
himself to be admired by the numerous beautiful
women he passes, he is supremely happy, and
condescendingly deigns to stare at the most handsome
of those whom he meets, with undisguised
impudence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the evening he goes to a party—should he be
lucky enough to be invited to one, by those who
gave it, or by some <span class='it'>lady</span> who has been herself invited—there
he appears in all the brilliancy of a
little coat, tight trowsers, fancy vest, and cravat-tie.
Perhaps he small-talks with the lovely Emma, or
drawls out some observation about “the weathah,”
to Miss Mary. Perhaps he may even waltz in the
modern style—which is certainly the most ridiculous
and vulgar that has yet been taught in the
schools.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let the uninitiated reader imagine the right arm
of the Exquisite placed very carefully round the
waist of the delicate creature, so as to draw her
closely to him—let it be supposed that he holds his
left arm straight out from the shoulder, bending it at
the elbow, and extending his hand above his head—think,
that with that hand he grasps the taper engloved
fingers of the fair one, which hold a closed
fan—presume that the other arm of the dear creature
rests lovingly on the right shoulder of the dandy,
and her head also, if she feels dizzy—picture to the
mind the exquisite on his tip-toes, afflicted also with
a chronic bend at the knees, which defies straightening—suppose
that his back is so curved that his head
hangs over the face of his partner—in fact, imagine
the figure which a mark of interrogation would cut
in a waltz with a note of admiration, and you have
a faint idea of the awkward appearance of a buck
and belle, about to start off in the Redowa or Schottische.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even if imagination can picture these things,
it will be insufficient to realize fully, the latest style
of waltzing, which bears but little resemblance to
the same diversion of five years ago. The word
<span class='it'>twiddle</span>, is about the only one which can convey a
notion of the modern step; which is no more the
measured “one,” “two,” “three” of the old waltz,
but is rather a mincing trot, in which the dancers
sometimes scud backward or forward for considerable
distances, or occasionally spin round in dizzy
circles, or gyrate in semicircles from right to left,
and then from left to right, the body of the dandy all
crooked and ungraceful as possible, and the fair one
yielding herself a languishing victim to the direction
of the fop, and resting in his arms with the most innocent
abandonment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If there should happen to be no party in the first
circles in the evening—the history of which we are
now writing—the Exquisite goes to the opera, if
Maretzek happens to be in town. Here he uses his
<span class='it'>lorgnette</span> with vigor, and gazes at all the ladies in
the boxes. At times, he smites the kid-glove in his
right hand against that upon his left, or shouts in a
weak voice and at the wrong time “Bravo.” Perchance
he expatiates to his neighbor upon the <span class='it'>poetamentt
della voce</span> of Bosio, or asserts that Salvi’s
head voice is failing.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i046.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0011' style='width:70%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>But although he may do something here with his
opera-glass, the great place for his triumphs with
that instrument is at a Hayes or Lind concert at the
“Musical Fund Hall.” It is one of the most confirmed
tests of the merits of an exquisite, that his
sight is not good. There are unfortunates who are
not fops, to whom Heaven has been pleased to assign
but a limited scope of vision—it therefore does
not follow that every short-sighted person is a dandy,
but <span class='it'>e converso</span>, as the lawyers say, every dandy is
indubitably short-sighted. The malady has become
epidemic within a few years, and an exquisite would
not be admitted into society without this optical certificate
of his worthiness. To prove his title he
relies upon an eye-glass which hangs by a cord or
chain from his button-hole, and whenever there is
aught to be seen he inspects it with nose bestrid with
these queer-looking aids to the eye. The failing has
advanced gradually until confirmed myopia has become
alarmingly prevalent, and the number and appearance
of adventitious helps to the vision has so
increased that the fashionable preparations for a concert
or opera now-a-days are formidable. A quizzing-glass
in times gone by was an offensive ostentation.
It made no odds if the possessor was as blind
as a brick wall without windows, he was sneered at,
and liable to continual insult if he dared to endeavor
to put himself upon an optical par with other people;
but by degrees this prejudice was done away with,
and as the rights of seeing advanced the necessity
became apparent. Double-glasses for each eye succeeded
the old quizzers—then the single-barrel
diminutive spy-glass was brought forth with fear and
trembling. It lived down opposition, and was succeeded
by larger instruments of the same pattern.
At length small double-barreled opera-glasses, with
handles, were seen in the first circles—they were
permitted, and since that time <span class='it'>lorgnettes</span> have been
growing bigger and bigger until they look like awful
monsters, all eyes, which by unhappy fate have been
linked together, Cyclopean Siamese twins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this is a visionary digression—we must go
back to the dandies at fashionable concerts. Here
he amuses himself by scanning the faces of the performers
and persons near him. As soon as the intermission
commences the fop rises, and distrusting
his sight altogether, relies upon his <span class='it'>lorgnette</span> for a
proper view of the lady who sat next to him during
the first part of the performance. His fellow dandies
imitate him, and the fair and confused object of
short-sighted devotion is made the centre for the
focus of fifty opera-glasses, raised without blushing
by as many asses, who believe that they are acting
quite genteelly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having got through with this ceremony, and having
heard the Hayes entirely through the programme,
the buck repairs to “Guys” or “Pelletiers,” and
eats or drinks whatever his rich acquaintances request
and pay for. After a time he returns to his
room in the fifth story, goes to bed and snores until
eleven next morning, when the servant enters to
awaken him to another day of similar events.</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;My spirit-love between—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Each age, each race, inscribes itself, with more
or less distinctness, on History’s dial. Nineveh,
almost faded from our traditions of the world’s infancy,
revisits us in her freshly exhumed sculptures
and in the vivid narrations of Layard. The Egypt
of Sesostris and the Pharaohs survives no less in her
pyramids and obelisks than in the ever-enduring records
of Moses and Manetho. Jerusalem, in her
lonely humiliation, best typifies the Hebrew state
and race. Ancient Rome lives for us in the Capitol
and the Coliseum, as does her mediæval and sacerdotal
offspring and namesake in St. Peter’s and the
Vatican. Royal and feudal France, the France of
Richelieu and Louis le Grand, still lingers in the
boundless magnificence and prodigality, the showy
sieges and battle-pieces of Versailles. The England
of the last three centuries confronts us in the Bank—not
a very stately nor graceful edifice, it must be
allowed; but very substantial and well furnished—the
fit heart’s core of a trading, money-getting people.
So we Americans of the Nineteenth Century
will be found in due time to have inscribed ourselves
most legibly, though all unconsciously, on the earth’s
unfading records—how, or in what, time alone can
tell. Perhaps a railroad over the Rocky Mountains,
a telegraph across the Atlantic, a towering observatory
wherein all the storms and calms at any moment
prevailing within the earth’s atmosphere shall
be portrayed on a common dial-plate, and the storms
which <span class='it'>shall</span> take place at any point during the next
day or week, with their several directions and intensities—perhaps
something very different from any
of these. Essential History still insists on writing
itself, and will not be controlled nor anticipated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>—<span class='sc'>The Crystal Palace</span>, with its contents and
purposes, was the clearest expression yet given to
the spirit and aspirations of our time—aspirations
not wholly utterable nor even comprehensible as
yet, but sufficiently so to demand and reward our
deepest attention. That Palace was the first edifice
ever built for and consecrated to the uses of Universal
Industry. It was the first structure ever devoted
to the advancement and diffusion of the Useful Arts
throughout the world—the first in which, to the
greatest extent consistent with individual selfishness,
the arcana of skill and production were thrown open
to all mankind, with an express invitation, “Come
hither, and see how the most successful workers accomplish
their ends, and learn to rival or excel them
if you can.” Herein was assembled the first general
convention or council of Captains of Industry—the
first practical Peace Congress ever held. Magnificent
in conception and most triumphant in execution,
this grand and fruitful enterprise deserves something
more than the journalist’s fleeting paragraph. We
cannot waste the time that we devote to its contemplation,
even though I should succeed no farther
than in drawing your attention to the subject, leaving
it to be pondered unaided, unembarrassed, by my
crude and hasty suggestions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who first proposed a grand Exposition of the Industry
of all Nations at London, it were hardly worth
while to inquire. The suggestion might have presented
itself to any mind, and in fact probably <span class='it'>did</span>
present itself simultaneously, or at least independently,
to several. It was a natural sequence of the
profound peace everywhere prevailing—of the all-pervading
spirit of Enterprize generated by Commerce—of
the rapid march of Discovery and Invention—of
the steady growth and at length realized
importance of the Useful Arts. Good ideas are
rather abundant in our day—too plentiful to obtain
much credit from a busy, practical, work-day generation.
In this instance, however, the seed fell on
good ground, and the result was an immense though
not yet fully gathered harvest. Much credit is due
to those who first gave the idea hospitality and nurture,
until it expanded in the warm sunshine of Royal
favor into the benignant reality whereto the nations
were gathered. And perhaps the most influential
among the early and steadfast friends of the World’s
Exhibition was Albert, consort of Queen Victoria,
and one of the most constant and discriminating
among the patrons and visitors of the great undertaking.
In an age when princes are plainly falling
into discredit and disuse, let us remember the good
which this one powerfully aided to do, and not suffer
our republican prejudices to blind us to the moral.
Hereditary legislators and hereditary rulers are
plainly absurd; but hereditary patrons and stimulators
of inventive genius and industrial efficiency are
not to be disparaged. Let them be remembered in
the approaching day of kingly tribulation and aristocratic
downfall. There are better uses for even the
most obsolete and worthless than hanging them.
Royalty and Nobility may be at ever so ruinous a
discount, but Humanity is still at par. Kill the monarch,
but save alive the man. His purple wrappages
have cramped and concealed him; strip them
off and burn them, but respect the glorious image
of God which you have thereby unswathed and
liberated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor is it worth while to attempt adjusting the measure
of credit due respectively to Paxton and to
others, for the idea of the Crystal Palace and its consummation.
A solid, rather heavy, North-of-England
horticulturist, employed in overseeing the Duke
of Devonshire’s extensive gardens and conservatories,
has a new tropical plant confided to his charge,
which, by a perfect knowledge of his art and an unbounded
command of means, he induces to vegetate
and flourish in that high latitude—of course, in an
artificially fervid soil and under shielding glass.
Here it grows and aspires with unimagined rapidity
to an unprecedented height, threatening to shiver its
frail covering in its upward career. Necessity, mother
of invention, pricks on the unideal gardener to
enlarge, and still enlarge, his glass shelter, which
this aspiring rival of Jack’s Bean-Stalk threatens to
put his head and arms through in quest of altitude
and sunshine: so he elevates and expands his crystal
encasement, until, little by little, step by step, a
stately glass house has been erected; and this becomes
the model of the hitherto unsuggested Crystal
Palace. The gardener had no premonition of this,
no idea of anything beyond sheltering his delicate
though gigantic plant, and saving its artificial Timbuctoo
from destruction:</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“He builded wiser than he knew.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>But when plans and designs for the immense edifice
required to hold the contributions of all nations
to the grand Exposition were advertised for, he was
prepared to compete for the proffered reward; and
his plan, dictated to him by Nature herself, was
found the best of all, adopted, and, with some necessary
modifications of detail, carried into effect. The
result was the Crystal Palace, the most capacious,
convenient, economical, healthful, and admirable
structure ever devised for any kindred purpose.
Earth was ransacked for alluring marvels; Science
racked its brains for brilliant combinations; Art exhausted
its subtle alchemy in quest of dazzling effects;
Labor poured out its sweat like rain to fill this
grand receptacle with whatever is beautiful and winning:
yet the Crystal Palace remained to the end
the crowning triumph of all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within the last century, London has expanded
rapidly and immensely, but especially toward the
West, or up the Thames. Temple Bar, the western
boundary of the city proper, (or ancient London,) is
now considerably East, I think, of the center of the
Great Metropolis; while the present residences of
nearly all the nobility and gentry are built on grounds
which were open country since the days of the
Plantagenets and Tudors. In the center of this magnificent
“West end,” between St. James’s Palace
and Kensington Gardens, though much nearer the
latter, stretches <span class='sc'>Hyde Park</span>, one of the most spacious
and pleasant expanses of sward and shade and
water that eye ever feasted on. Boston Common
would be somewhat like it, if it were ten times as
large and twenty times as well watered as at present.
Hyde Park is the favorite resort of the Aristocracy
for equestrian and carriage exercise, and
thoroughly justifies their choice. On the southern
verge of this noble expanse, some three miles West
of the Bank, Exchange, and London Bridge, the
Crystal Palace was erected. It was not an imposing
edifice. No stately gateway, no frowning turrets,
no graceful spire, no lofty tower, marked the
capacious structure from whose roof the flags of all
nations rose and floated in perfect amity. Its slender
ribs of iron, covered and hidden for some thirty feet
from the earth by boards, like any house of wood,
were thenceforth visible through the glass which
formed the upper siding and roof, like a spider’s web
on the grass of a dewy morning. Slender iron columns
or pillars, rising at intervals unperceived from
beneath the floor, helped to sustain the weight of the
slight yet ponderous roof, through which, though
covered with canvass to modify the heat of the few
sunny days vouchsafed to an English summer, as
abundance of light, not only under the murkiest
London skies, but even during the prevalence of
the great July eclipse, was at all times received.
So immense was the volume of atmosphere enclosed,
or so perfect the arrangements for ventilation, that
no sense of exhaustion or of breathing vitiated air
was at any time experienced; for the building was
something more than a third of a mile in length from
east to west, some three hundred feet wide, and
rather more than a hundred feet from floor to roof,
with eight or ten large doors for entrance and exit
hardly ever closed during the day. On a volume of
atmosphere thus extended, and constantly changing,
the breathings of sixty thousand persons for hours
could make no impression. In this vast bazaar,
which a few months saw advance from its first conception
to its perfect realization, and which yet was
barely completed at the day appointed for opening
the exhibition, the choice or characteristic products
of all nations had already for some weeks been accumulating.
Under the mere corner (though of itself
covering more than an acre) devoted to machinery,
mainly British, water-pipes and adaptations of
steam-power had already been conducted, the steam
itself being generated outside. An army of carpenters
and other artisans had been some weeks at work
on the fixtures and decorations of the several departments,
so that, when the eagerly expected opening
day at length arrived, although the whole visible
area had an unmistakable aspect of haste and rawness—an
odor born of green boards and fresh paint,—and
although an infinity of carpenters’ work still remained
undone, especially in the galleries or upper
story, yet the Exhibition was plainly there, and
only needed time to perfect its huge proportions,
and stand forth the acknowledged wonder of the
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first of May, 1851, was a happy day for London.
Her skies had relaxed something of their
habitual sullenness to usher in the pageant whereby
the Sovereign of the Realm, surrounded by her chief
councilors and grandees, was to inaugurate the first
grand Exhibition of All Nations’ Industry. The
rain, which had dripped or pattered almost or quite
daily for weeks, held up the evening before and promised
not to return for this whole May-day—a promise
which was only broken by a slight shower at
noon, too late to mar the interest or pleasure of the
festival. At an early morning hour, a strong current
of human life set westward from the city proper toward
Hyde Park, and long before the doors of the
House of Glass were opened, they were surrounded
by eager groups, though no admission was purchasable
save at the cost of a season ticket—over fifteen
dollars. Even thus, some thirty thousand enjoyed
and swelled the in-door pageant; while perhaps ten
times as many gazed from the parks and streets at
the meagre procession out-doors which escorted the
Queen from her palace of St. James to the airier,
richer palace of the working millions, the hall of
vastest prophecy. They arrived, a robed and jeweled
procession of Princes and Embassadors—of noble
Ladies and noble Workers—the Duke of Wellington
and Mr. Paxton—the Master of the Buckhounds,
Groom of the Stole, Gentleman Usher of Sword and
State, Gold Stick in Waiting, Silver Stick in Waiting,
and other such antediluvian absurdities—attended
Her Majesty, along with the Foreign Commissioners,
Architects of the edifice, her older children,
and some other living verities, on her slow and measured
progress from side to side and end to end of
the mighty convocation. This strange mingling of
the real with the shadowy, the apposite with the
obsolete, gave additional piquancy and zest to the
spectacle. Had the courtly symbols of an out-worn,
out-grown feudal age appeared by themselves, we
might have taken them for some fanciful creation of
a mind diseased by reading Froisart and Walter
Scott, and watched to see them exhale like ghosts
at cock-crowing; but here they are so mixed up and
blended with undeniable entities; with the solid and
practical Prince Albert; with our own portly and
palpable Embassador; with that world-known Celestial
who accompanies and illustrates the Chinese
Junk, himself first of matter-of-fact conservatives—a
walking, human Junk—that we cannot refuse to
credit its total verity, in spite of the glaring anachronisms.
Then there was a prosy though proper Address
read by Prince Albert as head of the Royal
Commission to his Royal consort as head of the
kingdom, telling her how the Exhibition was first
started, and how it had moved onward till now—rather
superfluous it must be confessed, since they
had doubtless talked the matter all over between them
a dozen times when much more at their ease, and in
a far more satisfactory manner; but Queens must endure
and take part in some dreary absurdities as well
as other people. This speech was through in time,
and was very briefly and fittingly responded to. I
trust the prayer which the Archbishop of Canterbury
sent up in behalf of us all was as graciously received.
There was some music, rather out of place and lost
in the vastness of space to all but the few immediately
under the Transept, and some other performances;
but all in perfect order, in due and punctual
season, without a betrayal of awkwardness or conscious
incongruity. Between two and three o’clock
the pageant was at an end,—the Royal cortege departed,
and the Exhibition formally opened. Let
me now try to give some general notion of its character,
by glancing at the more obvious details, so far
as I, at this distance of time and space, may be able
to recall them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are doors on all sides, one or more devoted
exclusively to the reception of articles for exhibition;
one for Jurors in attendance on the Fair; others
for the Police, the Royal visitors, &amp;c.; while the
main entrances for paying visitors are upon the south
side, into the Transept. But we will enter one of the
three or four doors at the east end, and find ourselves
at once in the excessive space devoted to contributions
from the United States, and which thence seems
sparsely filled. Before us are large collections of
Lake Superior Native Copper, as it was torn from
the rock, in pieces from the size of a bean up to one
slab of more than a ton, though still but a wart beside
some masses which have been wrenched from
the earth’s bosom, cut into manageable pieces of two
to three tons, and thus dispatched to the smelting
furnace and a market. New Jersey Zinc, from the
ore to the powder, the paint, the solid metal, is
creditably represented; and there are specimens of
Adirondack Iron and Steel from Northern New-York
which attract and reward attention. Passing
these and various cabinets or solitary specimens of
the Minerals of Maryland and other States, we are
confronted by abundant bales of Cotton, barrels of
Wheat and of Flour, casks of Rice, &amp;c.; while various
clusters of ears of our yellow and white Indian
Corn remind the English of one valued staple which
our climate abundantly vouchsafes and theirs habitually
denies. The “Bay State” Shawls of Lawrence,
the Axes of Maine, the Flint Glass of Brooklyn, the
Daguerreotypes of New-York and Philadelphia,
(whose excellence was acknowledged from the first
by nearly every critic,) next salute us; and near them
are the specimens of various Yankee Locks, and in
their midst the invincible Hobbs, a small, young,
shrewd, quiet-seeming Yankee, but evidently distinguished
for penetration, who would have made
fewer enemies in England had he proved a less potent
master of his calling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now we are at the Grand Aisle, across which
is the U. S. Commissioner’s office, with that much
ridiculed “pasteboard eagle” displayed along its
front, and certainly looking as if its appetite would
overtax any ordinary powers of digestion. In front
of the office are Yankee Stoves, Safes, Light Wagons,
and Carriages, Plows and other agricultural implements,
including the since famous “Virginia Reaper,”
which was for months a butt of British journalistic
waggery, having been described by one Reporter as
“a cross between an Astley’s chariot, a flying machine,
and a treadmill.” They spoke of it far more
respectfully after it had been set to work, with memorable
results; and it must in fairness be confessed
that beauty is not its best point, and that while nothing
is more effective in a grain-field, many things
would be more comely in a drawing-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But let us return to the main aisle, and, starting at
its eastern end, proceed westward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A model Railroad Bridge of wood and iron fills a
very large space at the outset, and is not deemed by
British critics a brilliant specimen of Yankee invention.
(One of them, however, at length candidly
confessed that its capacity of endurance and of resistance
must be very great, or the weight of ridicule
heaped upon it must inevitably have broken it
down long before.) Upon it is a handsome show of
India Rubber fabrics by Goodyear; while beyond it,
toward the west, in a chosen locality in the center
of the isle, stands “the Greek Slave” of Powers,
one of the sweetest and most popular achievements
of the modern chisel, here constantly surrounded by
a swarm of admirers; yet I think it not the best of
Powers’ works—I am half inclined to say not <span class='it'>among</span>
his best. He has several stronger heads, possessing
far more character, in his studio at Florence; and
yet I am glad this statue was in the Exhibition, for
it enabled the critics of the London press to say
some really smart things about Greek and American
slaves, and the Slave as a representative and masterpiece
of American artistic achievement, which that
heavy metropolis could not well have spared. Let
us not grudge them a grin, even at our expense; for
mirth promotes digestion, and the hit in this instance
is certainly a fair one. “The Dying Indian,” just
beside the Slave, by a younger and less famous
American artist, is a work of power and merit,
though the delineation of agony and approaching
death can hardly be rendered pleasing. Is it not
remarkable that a chained and chattelized woman,
and a wounded, dying Indian, should be the subjects
chosen by American sculptors for their two
works whereby we shall be most widely known in
connection with this Exhibition?—But we cross the
imaginary line which here separates the United
States from the nations of Continental Europe, and
look westward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How magnificent the prospect! Far above is the
sober sky of canvass-covered glass, through which
the abundant light falls gently and mellowly. Spacious
and richly decorated galleries, some sixty feet
apart, overhang all the ground floor but the grand
aisle, and are themselves the depositories of many of
the richest and most tempting fabrics and lighter
wares exhibited. The aisle itself, farther than the
eye can reach, is studded with works of art; statues
in marble, in bronze, in plaster, in zinc; here a gigantic
Amazon on horseback, there a raging lion, a
classic group, or a pair of magnificent bronze vases
enriched with exquisite representations of scenes
from the master-singers of antiquity. Busts, Casts,
Medallions, and smaller Bronzes abound; with elegant
Clocks, Chandeliers, Cabinets, etc.; for each
nation whose department we pass has arranged its
most enticing products in front, so that they shall be
seen from the grand aisle, putting its homelier though
in some cases intrinsically more valuable productions
in the back-ground. Russia’s superb tables and slabs
of richest Malachite stand just far enough out of the
aisle within her allotted space to draw thither the
wandering gazer, to view her imperial structures of
gilded Porcelain, colored Glass and other barbaric
marvels. Austria has brought hither and put in order
a suite of rooms sumptuously furnished and ornamented
according to her highest ideal of taste and
luxury. France displays in the fore-ground her admirable
Bronzes, Porcelain, Musical Instruments,
etc.; and so Northern Germany, Switzerland, Belgium,
and other European states, each “puts its best
foot foremost,” in a sense hardly metaphorical. Behind
these dainty and rare fabrics are ranged others
less difficult of achievement—costly Silks and Laces;
then Woolens and Muslins; and behind these you
often stumble on coils of Rope or Wire; bars of
Steel or pigs of Iron; Saws, Files, and Hammers;
Stoves, Grates, and Furnaces; Bedsteads, Chairs,
and Lanterns—these, as you pass laterally from the
dazzling glories of the centre aisle, between the
well-filled sub-compartments devoted to fabrics of
taste and adornment, will greet you before you reach
the outer walls. For the Crystal Palace has its
homelier aspects, like any other, and it but follows
the general usage in keeping them as much in the
back-ground as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we pass on down the Grand Aisle, to the
Transept or cross, where both the height and width
of the building are considerably increased, in order,
it would seem, to save two stately and beautiful
trees (elms), which here stand in opposition some
two hundred feet apart. The Transept embraces
and covers both, leaving each ample room to grow
and flourish; while half-way between them, in the
exact center of the Palace, a spacious and copious
Fountain, wholly of glass, throws its sparkling torrent
high into the air, whence it descends from crystal
cup to cup, each considerably wider than that
next above it, until it reaches the lowest and largest
near the ground, thence gliding away unseen.
There are few finer effects in the Exhibition than
this of the Crystal Fountain, which utterly shames
the Koh-i-Noor, or “Mountain of Light,” said to be
the largest diamond in the world, and computed
worth several millions of dollars, which, obviously
over-guarded against robbery, rests in its gilded cage
beside the Fountain. No child, looking from one
to the other, ever suspected, until told it, that the
Diamond was deemed worth more than the Fountain.
Here are displayed full-length portraits of
Queen Victoria and her husband—the latter, once
handsome, now gross-featured and rather heavy, but
still a man of fair appearance, good sense and varied
information. The Queen, never beautiful, has sacrificed
her youthful freshness to the cares of maternity
and the exactions of late hours and luxurious living,
so that at thirty-two she looks plain and old—not in
this portrait, but in her living self. But uncommon
energy, activity, shrewdness, with an earnest desire
to please her people and promote their welfare, still
remain to her, and have rendered her the most popular
British Sovereign of the Guelphic family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Transept is the heart of the Exhibition, to
which all currents converge, from which all expeditions,
whether of criticism or discovery, take their
departure. Here abound Marble Statues, gigantic
Brazen Gates, and other works of Art; while around
it are located the fabrics of Turkey and of China, of
Australia, and of British America, which are as interesting
and instructive in their rudeness and clumsiness
as others in their grace and perfection. You
could hardly realize without seeing them what
wretched contrivances for Candlesticks, Culinary
Utensils, Locks and Keys, etc., etc., are still slowly,
toilsomely fabricated in Turkey, in Barbary, and in
other half-civilized countries. A decent knowledge
of the Useful Arts is yet confined to a few nations,
and is imperfectly diffused even in these. And here,
too, is sad Italy, not allowed to compete in her own
name, but sending feeble and timid contributions, as
“Sardinia,” “Tuscany,” “Rome,” etc., nothing
being allowed to come from Naples. The Roman
States, in the heart of ancient Civilization, with
Three Millions of People yet, fill half-a-page of the
Catalogue, or about one-seventeenth of the space required
by the more distant United States; while the
beautiful Statuary of the School of Milan, including
the Veiled Vestal, one of the most original and admirable
works in the Exhibition, is set down to the
credit of <span class='it'>Austria</span>! There is a debtor as well as
creditor side to that Austro-Italian account, and settlement
cannot be refused forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Great Britain and her Colonies engross the entire
Western half of the Exhibition, and fill it creditably.
In the Fine Arts, properly so called, she has probably
less than a fourth of what is contributed; but in
Iron and its multiform products she has far more
than all the World beside. In Steam Engines and
Force-Pumps, Looms and Anvils, Ores and Castings,
Buttons, Steel-Pens, etc., all the rest combined could
not compare with her. I doubt if the world ever
before saw so complete and instructive a collection
of Ores and Minerals as are here brought together,
or that Geology was ever studied under auspices
more favorable than this collection would afford.
Nearly every metal known to man may here be
seen, first as ore, and then in every stage up to that
of perfect adaptation to our various human needs.
So in the department of Machinery. I think no collection
so varied and complete of Looms, Presses,
Mills, Pumps, Engines, etc., etc., was ever before
grouped under one roof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The immense Manufacturing capacity and aptitude
of Great Britain are here abundantly represented.
From the unequaled Shawls of Cashmere to the
fabrics woven of reeds or bark by Australian savages;
from the Coal of Pictou to the Spices of Ceylon; almost
every thing which mankind have agreed to value
and consecrate as property, is collected in the western
half of the Crystal Palace, under the folds of the
meteor flag, and displayed as specimens of the products
of Queen Victoria’s spacious Realm. Here
Manchester unrolls her serviceable fabrics, and Birmingham
displays her cheap and varied wares; here
Sheffield, Glasgow, Belfast, and other centers of a
vast manufacturing activity, solicit your attention to
whatever is most showy or most substantial among
their multiform productions. Gilded Fire-places of
silver-shining steel, or snowy, speckless marble;
vessels of Iron, of Clay, or of Tin; Robes and
Couches, Cannon and Bibles, Grind-stones and
Pianos, by turns arrest the gaze in a bewildering
medley, which yet is not quite confusion; for most
of the articles are roughly classified, and the vast
area is divided into an infinity of apartments, or
“courts,” closed at the sides, which are covered
with cards of their proper wares, as is often the end
farthest from the center aisle, and sometimes a good
part of the front also. Behind each court is an open
passage-way, walled in by displays usually of homely
wares and fabrics, mainly of iron, or brass, and behind
these again are other courts, more open and irregular
than the former, devoted to Castings, Metals,
Ores, and the ruder forms of mineral wealth, occasionally
giving place to the Refreshment Saloons
wherewith the Palace is abundantly provided—to
Committee Rooms, Jury Rooms, and other incidents
of the Exhibition. And, thus environed, we move
on, westward, until the grand Machinery Room absorbs
henceforth the entire space to the north of us,
the hum of its innumerable Wheels, Rotary Pumps,
Looms, Spinning-Jennies, Flax-Dressers, Printing-Presses,
etc., etc., at all times audible from the distant
center of the Palace, in spite of well-directed
efforts to drown it. At last we reach the western
doorway, half-obstructed by gigantic Bells and other
bulky Manufactures, beyond which is the naked
Park, or would be but for the still huger blocks of
Coal, Stone, etc., for which no place could be made
within the building—and our journey is at an end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But no—we have not yet mounted to the upper
story, whither four broad and spacious stairways in
different parts of the building invite us. Here is a
new immensity of Silks and Scarfs, of Millinery and
costly Furniture, including illustrations of the Spaniard’s
ideal of sumptuous magnificence: here Belgium
has tried her hand at bronzes with indifferent,
and at castings with considerable success: here the
finest achievements in Paper-Hanging and Window-Shading
adorn the walls for hundreds of feet, some
of the spacious curtains scarcely inferior in effect to
any but the very best paintings; while the thousand
costly trifles born of Parisian art and elegance vie
with London’s less graceful but more massive creations
in filling the vast amphitheatre with wealth beyond
the wildest dreams of a Sindbad or Alladin.
Such Pyramids of Jewelry and Plate were never
before collected under one roof. Clusters of Pearls
and Diamonds, each a generous fortune, are here lost
in the ocean of magnificence; a single firm has One
Million Dollars’ worth within a moderate compass;
while the displays of rivals in pandering to luxury
and ostentation stretch on either hand as far as the
vision can reach. The industry and practical genius
of Britain are evinced in the Machinery and serviceable
Fabrics below, but her unequalled riches
and aristocratic pomp are more vividly depicted
here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the eyes ache, the brain reels, with this never-ending
succession of the sumptuous and the gorgeous;
one glimpse of sterile heath, bare sand, or beetling
crag, would be a sensible relief. Wearily we turn
away from this maze of sensual delights, of costly
luxuries, and listlessly wander to that part of the
gallery nearest the Transept, with its towering Elms,
its Crystal Fountain, its gigantic Brazen Gates, its
Statues, its Royal Portraits, and Caged Diamond;
but these we do not care to look upon again. <span class='sc'>Man</span>
is nobler than the works of his hands; let us pause
and observe. Hark! the clock strikes ten; the gates
are opened; the crowds which had collected before
them begin to move. No tickets are used; no
change given; it is a “shilling day,” and whoever
approaches any of the gates which open to the general
public must have his shilling in hand, so as to
pay without stopping the procession as he passes in.
In twenty minutes our scattered, straggling band of
Jurors, Exhibitors, Policemen and servitors will have
been swelled by at least ten thousand gazers; within
the hour fifteen thousand more have added themselves
to the number; by one o’clock the visitors have increased
to fifty thousand: every corner and nook
swarm with them; even the alleys and other standing
room in the gallery are in good part blocked with
them; but the wave-like, endless procession which
before and below us sweeps up and down the Central
Aisle is the grand spectacle of all. From our
elevated and central position almost the entire length
of this magnificent promenade is visible, from the
pasteboard eagle of America on the east to the massive
bells and other heavy British products which
mark the western door, though the view is somewhat
broken by a few towering trophies of artistic skill,
to which places have been assigned at intervals in
the middle of the aisle, leaving a broad passage-way
on either side. Far as the eye can reach, a sea of
human heads is presented, denser toward the center
just before us, but with scarcely an interruption any
where. The individuals which make up this marching
array are moving in opposite directions, or turning
off to the right or to the left, and so lost to our view in
“Austria,” “Russia,” “Switzerland,” or “France;”
but the river flows on unchecked, undiminished,
though the particular drops we gazed on a minute
ago have passed from our view for ever. Still,
mainly from the South, a steady stream of new
comers, fifty to a hundred per minute, is pouring in
to join the eager throng, but scarcely suffice to swell
it. The machinery-room, the galleries, the side-passages,
the refreshment saloons, absorb as fast as
the in-flowing current can supply; until,
about three o’clock, the tide turns, and the departures
thence exceed the arrivals. At length the hour of
six strikes, and the edifice is quietly, noiselessly vacated
and closed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this vast tide of life, which ebbs and flows
beneath our gaze as we stand in the gallery, near as
we may to the Crystal Fount, is not a mere aggregation
of human beings. London, herself a mimic
world, has sent hither not merely her thousands but
her tens. Among that moving mass you may recognize
her ablest and her wisest denizens—her De
la Beche, her Murchison, her Brewster, and others
honorably distinguished in the arduous paths of
Science. Here, too, are her Cobden, her Sturge,
her Russell, and others eminent in council and in
legislative halls. Of the Peers who make her their
winter residence, the names of Canning, Granville,
Wharncliffe, Argyle, De Mauley and others are
honorably connected with the Exhibition, to which
they give their time as Jurors; and they are among
its almost daily visitors, mainly distinguished by
their quiet bearing and simple, unpretending manners.
And there, too, may be often seen the age-enfeebled
frame of her veteran Wellington, the
victor in so many hard-fought fields and the final
vanquisher of the greatest of modern warriors.
Though his eye is dim and his step no longer firm,
the conqueror of Hindostan, the liberator of the Peninsula,
the victor of Waterloo, still emphatically
“the Duke,” is among the most absorbed and constant
visitors of the great Exhibition, carefully
scanning the more interesting objects in detail, and
gazing by the hour on achievements so different
from those of Assays, Salamanca and the Chateau
of Hougomont. Do those dull ears, though deafened
by twenty years’ familiarity with the roar of artillery,
catch some prophetic premonition of the New
Age dawning upon mankind, wherein Carnage and
Devastation shall no more secure the world’s proudest
honors, while Invention and Production sink
into unmarked graves? Sees that dim eye, rekindled
for a moment by the neighborhood of death, the
approach of that glorious era wherein Man the creator
and beautifier shall be honored and feted and
Man the destroyer discrowned? His furrowed
brow, his sunken eye, return no answer to our
eager question, as he slowly, thoughtfully plods on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But not London, not England, alone: the Civilized
World is here strongly represented. America and
Russia, France and Austria, Belgium and Spain,
have here <a id='their'></a>their Commissioners, their Notables,
their <span class='it'>savans</span>, earnestly studying the Palace and its
contents, eager to carry away something which
shall be valued and useful at home. A Yankee
Manufacturer passes rapidly through the Machinery-room
until his eye rests on a novel combination for
weaving certain fabrics, when, after watching it
intently for a few minutes, he claps his hands and
exclaims in unconscious, irrepressible enthusiasm,
“That will pay my expenses for the trip!” On
every side sharp eyes are watching, busy brains are
treasuring, practical fingers are testing and comparing.
Here are shrewd men from the ends of the
earth: can it be that they will go home no wiser
than they came? Many are here officially, and
under pay from their respective governments; some
of them sent out of compliment to Her Majesty,
who specially invited the coöperation of their masters;
but there are skillful artificers, and mechanics
also, from Paris, from Brussels, and from far Turin,
sent here by subscription expressly that they may
study, profit by and diffuse the Arts here exhibited in
perfection. About the pleasantest fellow <span class='it'>I</span> met in
London was a Turkish official, military by profession,
born a Frenchman, but naturalized at Stamboul,
who spoke good English and seemed to understand
the world very fairly, though (I judge) rather
less a Saint than a Philosopher. The noblest and
truest man I encountered in Europe was a Belgian
Manufacturer and Juror; and though there were
doubtless many unworthy persons attracted to London
by the novel spectacle, I doubt whether any
General Council of the Christian Church has ever
convened an assemblage on the whole superior,
morally and intellectually, to that summoned to
London by the great Exhibition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So much for the Crystal Palace and its Contents.
And now of its Lessons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I rank first among these that of the practicability
and ultimate certainty of Universal Peace. There
have been several amateur Peace Congresses after
a fashion; but I esteem this the first satisfactory
working model of a Peace Congress. The men of
the Sword and their champions tell us that Nations
<span class='it'>will not</span> submit their conflicting claims and jarring
interests to the chances of Arbitration; but here they
<span class='it'>did</span> it, and with the most satisfactory results. Individual
heart-burnings there must ever be; cases of
injustice, neglect of merit, and partiality; there probably
were; but as a whole, the award of Prizes at
the Fair was discriminating and satisfactory. If the
representatives of rival nations there assembled had
set to fighting for the honor and credit of their several
countries; hired all the bravoes and marketable
ruffians they could find to help them; run in debt for
more than they were worth; and finally burned up
the Glass Palace with all its contents in the heat of
the fray—who imagines that the result would have
been more conclusive and satisfactory than it now
is? Yet the contrast between the settlement of National
differences by War and by Arbitration is as
favorable to the latter mode as in the parallel case
of rival pretensions to superiority in Art and Industry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But while I hold that Arbitration is the true mode
of settling National differences, and War at all times
a blunder and a crime on the part of those who wage
it, refusing to arbitrate, I do <span class='it'>not</span> therefore hold that
those who seek only justice should disarm and proclaim
their unqualified adhesion to the doctrines of
Non-Resistance, and thus invite the despot, the
military adventurer, the pirate, to overrun and ravage
at their will. I do not believe that peace and justice
are in this way attainable, but by quite a different,
an almost opposite course. Let the lovers of Freedom
and Right repudiate all standing armies, all
military conquests, under any conceivable circumstances—all
aggressive interference in the domestic
concerns of other nations; but let each People be
essentially prepared to resist tyranny at home and
repel invasion from abroad, each with its own chosen
weapons when others shall have proved ineffective.
Let the just and pacific take up a position which
says to the restless and rapacious, “Be quiet, and
do not put us to the disagreeable necessity of quieting
you, which you see we are perfectly able to do,”—then
and thus we may hope for peace; but not
while the “old man,” absolutely relies on driving
off the “rude boys” who are “stealing his apples,”
with “words and grass” only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Akin to this is my view of the question of regulated
or unrestricted Trade between Nations, which
worthily holds so prominent a place in the popular
discussions of our time. That men should buy and
sell precisely as their several interests (real or fancied)
shall dictate, without interference therewith or
tax thereon by Governments,—this is a very natural
and popular demand, which clearly harmonizes with
a prevailing tendency of our time, whereof the deification
of the individual will and pleasure is the end.
But, standing amidst this labyrinth of British machinery,
this wilderness of European fabrics, I cannot
but ask,—How, with totally unregulated trade, is the
all but resistless tendency of Manufactures and Commerce
to Centralization to be resisted? How, for
instance, shall we rationally hope for the rapid, extensive
naturalization of new Arts, the establishment
of new and difficult branches of Manufacture, requiring
large capital, practiced skill and ample
markets to ensure their success, in any quarter of
the globe but Europe, while that continent remains
the focus of the world’s commercial activity and
thrift? Suppose, for example, an American should
be able to produce the richest and most tasteful
fabrics of the French or Flemish looms as cheaply
as, or even <span class='it'>more</span> cheaply than, his European rivals,—what
are his chances for success in the manufacture?
Are there ships departing from <span class='it'>our</span> seaports daily to
every inhabited portion of the earth, laden with the
assorted cargoes of ordered and anxiously expected
<span class='it'>American</span> fabrics? Have we great mercantile houses
engaged in buying up such American fabrics for exportation?
Nay, do our own Countrywomen stand
ready to buy his Bareges or Laces at the prices
which they are daily and freely paying for just such
goods from Europe? Suppose he <span class='it'>could</span> fabricate a
hundred thousand pieces per annum at the lowest
possible price for which they can be made in Europe,
could he sell them as fast as produced? No, he could
not; he does not. The producers in immediate proximity
to, in intimate relations with, the “merchant
princes” of Europe, who are the life-long factors of
the traders of India, of Australia, of Asia Minor,
Africa and Russia, have an immense advantage over
any rivals located on the Western Continent, or at
any similar distance from the commercial centers of
Western Europe. The rule that “To him who hath
shall be given, while from him who hath not shall
be taken away even that he hath,” is perpetually
and powerfully operative to concentrate the Manufactures
and Trade of the world upon London, Paris,
and their out-of-town workshops, which, for all
commercial purposes, are a part of themselves.
This Centralization, unchecked, tends to depopulate
and barbarize the rest of the earth to build up a
bloated and factitious prosperity in Western Europe—a
prosperity whereof the Laboring Millions are
instruments, not sharers—a prosperity whereof a
few immense fortunes, amassed at the cost of the
world’s impoverishment, are the sole enduring trophies.
The system which in the name of Free
Trade is calculated to secure a monopoly of Production
and Commerce in all but the ruder Arts and
Manufactures to Great Britain, France and Germany,
tends to tax the food-grower and the artisan half the
value of their respective products for the cost of
transporting them to and exchanging them with
each other, and so keep them in perpetual vassalage
and debt to the “merchant princes,” instead of rendering
them neighbors and direct exchangers, and
thus saving the heavy cost of reaching each other
across an ocean and a continent. These convictions
are not new to me, but they were strengthened by
weeks of earnest observation in the Crystal Palace.
More and more was I there convinced that Price is
not an infallible measure of Cost, and that a foreign
fabric is not proved cheaper than a home-made one
because it is purchased in preference, nor even because
it is sold at a lower price. If the whole Earth
is ever to be truly Civilized, it must be by the diffusion
of the Useful Arts and their Machinery rather
than of their finished products. If Universal Labor
is ever to be constantly employed and fairly rewarded,
it must be through a more direct and intimate
relation of laborer with laborer; not through the system
of complexity, aggregation and needless expense
wherein the grain-grower of Illinois hires, through
half a dozen intermediates, his Iron made in Wales,
and sends his grain thither to pay for the work, instead
of having it done at the ore-bed in his township,
with the coal which underlies the whole County.
I know how strong is the current against this view
of Labor’s true interest, but the world will refuse to
be ruled by names and plausibilities for ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Crystal Palace has other lessons for us
than those of Political Economy—it has Social suggestions
as well. Here are Hollow Brick, destined,
I think, to supersede nearly all others, saving half
the expense of solid brick for material and transportation;
being far more quickly and cheaply burned;
far more easily handled and laid; rendering houses
entirely free from dampness, less susceptible to
Summer’s heat and Winter’s cold, while proffering
new facilities for warming, ventilation, &amp;c. The
invention and diffusion of this Brick alone seem to
me worth to mankind the cost of the Exhibition.
Here, too, is Claussen, with his Flax discoveries
and processes, whereby the entire fiber of the plant
is separated from the woody matter of the stalk and
rendered as soft, fine, white and tractable as the
choicest Sea-Island Cotton, which it greatly resembles;
while, by a little change in the mode of preparing
it, it is made closely to imitate Linen, Cotton
or Woolen, and to blend freely in the same web with
either. The worth of this discovery to mankind can
hardly be over-estimated. Here, too, is his Circular
Loom, steadily weaving bags without a seam, and
capable of infinite varieties of practical application.
Here is McCormick, with his masterly Reaper, cutting
as clean as Death’s scythe, and almost as rapidly;
so that the field of waving grain, which the eye could
scarcely measure in the morning, has been transformed
by it into a field of naked stubble before
evening. Here is Ericsson, with his new Caloric
Engine, threatening to reduce steam to its primary
insignificance—as, indeed, hundreds have <span class='it'>threatened</span>
before, but as yet none have quite accomplished.
Let us hope that some of the present noble strivers
will be more successful; for, indeed, steam, though
it has done the world good service, is a most expensive
ally; the great bulk and weight of fuel
and water it requires to have carried along with it
have rendered it thus far entirely useless for locomotive
purposes except on a liquid or metallic track:
while the frequent stoppages it exacts, the nicety of
management it demands, and the serious disasters
its use involves, unite to proclaim that a blessed day
in which mankind shall be able to dispense with it.
Whether Ericsson, Page, or some other “visionary,”
shall achieve for us that victory, I dare not predict;
but that its achievement is close at hand, I affirm
with undoubting confidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A kindred improvement is about to be inaugurated
in the more extended and diversified employment of
<span class='sc'>Gas</span>. A hundred models of Gas Stoves, Gas Burners,
Gas Cooking Ranges, etc., were exhibited at the
Fair, each warranted, (as usual,) to save half the fuel
and render treble the service of any other; yet I was
not able to designate any one of them as particularly
meritorious, nor did the Jury on this department
award a premium to any. All seems yet crude and
infantile in this field of invention. Yet the study of
the various models and contrivances for Gas-burning
there presented, fixed me in the novel faith that Gas
is ultimately to be not only the main agent of illumination
but the chief fuel also of all cities and villages;
that the time is at hand when the head of a family,
the solitary lodger, requiring either heat or light, will
simply touch a bell in his own room and be supplied
with the indicated quantity of Gas, whether for culinary
purposes, for warmth, for light, or altogether;
and that thus the cost, the trouble, the dust, of making
fires in all parts of a building, carrying fuel thither
and removing ashes therefrom, will be obviated; and
a single fire, constantly maintained, subserve admirably
the purpose of them all, saving the labor and
cost of five hundred wasteful kindlings and clearings,
beside affording heat at the moment it is wanted, and
stopping its consumption the instant the want is
satisfied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is but one among a thousand noiseless agencies
constantly preaching the advantages and economies
of <span class='sc'>Combination</span>, and indicating the certainty that
through Coöperation lies the way whereby Labor
is to emerge from bondage, anxiety and need into
liberty and assured competence. This truth, long
apparent to the eye of Reason, threatens to be made
palpable even to stolidity and stagnation by the sharp
spur of Necessity. Rude, rugged Labor must organize
itself for its appointed task of production, or it
will soon have nothing to do. It must concentrate
its energies for the creation of commodious and economical
homes, or it will have no home but the
Union Work-house. It must save and combine its
earnings, for the purchase and command of Machinery;
or Machinery, owned by and working for
Capital alone, will reduce it to insignificance, want,
and despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On every side the onward march of Invention is
constant, rapid, inexorable. The human Reaper of
thirty years ago, finds to-day a machine cutting grain
twenty times as fast as ever he could; he gets three
days’ work as its waiter, where he formerly had
three weeks’ steady harvesting: the work is as well
done as of old, and far cheaper; but his share of the
product is sadly diminished. The Planing Machine
does the work of two hundred men admirably, and
pays moderate wages to three or four; the Sewing
Machine of moderate cost, performs easily and
cheaply the labors of forty seamstresses; but all the
seamstresses in the world probably do not own the
first machine. And so muscular force, or <span class='it'>mere</span> Labor,
becomes daily more and more a drug in the
market, shivers at the approach of winter, cringes
lower and lower at the glance of a machine-lord or
landlord, and vainly paces street after street, with
weary limbs and sinking heart, in quest of “something
to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only effectual remedy for this deplorable state
and still more deplorable tendency is found not in
Destruction but in Construction, not in Anarchy and
war on the rights of Property, but in Order and the
creation of more property by and for the Poor—not
in envy and hatred of the Rich, but in general study
and imitation of the forecast and frugality by which
they were made rich, which are as potent this hour
as they ever were, and which wise Coöperation will
render effective for the Poor of to-day. In this
country, where so much land is still unappropriated
and the legal right of Association is absolute and
universal, the Laboring Classes are masters of their
own destiny, and that of their brethren throughout
the world. A thousand young men, inured to labor
and as yet unburthened with families, can save at
least one hundred dollars each in the space of two
years if they will; and by wisely and legally combining
this in a capital of $100,000, investing it judiciously
in Land, Machinery and Buildings, under
the direction of their ablest and most responsible
members, they may be morally certain henceforth
of constant employment for each, under circumstances
which will ensure them the utmost efficiency
and the full reward of their labor. To Woman,
whose work is still more depressed and still more
meagerly rewarded, the means of securing emancipation
and just recompense are substantially the
same. The workers, in every department of industry,
may secure and own the Machinery best calculated
to give efficiency to their labor, if they will but
unitedly, persistently try. Through the scientific
Association of Labor and Capital, three-fourths of
them may within five years accomplish this, while
by heedlessness and isolated competition they are sure
to miss it, and see their condition grow gradually
worse and worse. Labor working <span class='it'>against</span> Machinery
is inevitably doomed, as the present condition
of the hand-loom weavers all over the globe
sufficiently attests; Labor working <span class='it'>for</span> Machinery,
in which it has no interest, can obtain in the average
but a scanty, precarious and diminishing subsistence;
while to Labor working <span class='it'>with</span> Machinery which it
owns and directs, there are ample recompense, steady
employment, and the prospect of gradual improvement.
Such is one of the great truths confirmed by
the lessons of the Crystal Palace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another truth forcibly taught there is that of the
steadiness of the march of Invention and the infinite
capacity of the laws and forces of Nature to minister
more and more readily and amply to the sustenance
and comfort of Man. We are obviously as yet on the
bare threshold of chemical discovery and mechanical
contrivance for the benefit of Man. The inventor
of the steam engine still lived within the memory of
many of us; yet even he never dreamed of the stupendous
improvements already made on his invention,
and the infinite adaptations to human wants of which
it is fully proved susceptible. A first-class North River
or Sound Steam-boat, much more an Atlantic Steam-ship,
would have astounded even <span class='it'>him</span>. But though
the capacities of Steam are not half exhausted, we
grow dissatisfied with its performance and impatient
of its conditions; we demand its power without its
weight, its bulk, its cost, its explosive tendencies, or
rather those of the elements from which it is evolved—and
Electricity, Air, Gunpowder, and other potencies
are analyzed and interrogated in quest of the
most advantageous substitute—a search which will
ultimately achieve success. The only question is
one of time. So in every department of mechanics
and manufactures: The victory of to-day opens the
path to grander and more beneficent victories to-morrow.
There never was a single mind capable of
conceiving and working out the idea of the Power
Printing-Press of to-day, nor that of the best Carpet-Looms
and Paper-Mills in use; each has been produced
by gradual, step-by-step improvement; the
goal of one inventor serving as the starting-point
of his successor; and often an invention which
failed to subserve its intended purpose has been
found eminently useful in a very different sphere and
connection; or, after having been cast aside as worthless,
has supplied the necessary hint to another inventor,
who has been guided by it to a new achievement
of signal beneficence. No real penetration into
the arcana of Nature’s forces was ever fruitless or
unsuggestive. The unpractical side of a newly discovered
scientific truth indicates the position and
nature of the practical side as well. To my mind
nothing is clearer than this—the immense strides and
vast scope of invention and discovery during the last
age, render morally certain the achievement of far
more and greater triumphs during the like period
just before us. The Railway and its train are by no
means the utmost possibilities of over-land locomotion;
the Telegraph is not the last word of electricity;
the Steam-ship is not the acme of Ocean navigation.
These ennobling triumphs herald others
which shall swiftly succeed them; and so in all the
departments of applied science. And among the
agencies which aided and accelerated the march of
Invention, which impelled the car of Industrial Progress,
I doubt not that our children, looking back
on that progress from heights whereof we can but
vaguely dream, will honorably distinguish the
World’s Exhibition of 1851.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor can we hesitate to class among the lasting
benefits of this Exhibition the wider and deeper
appreciation of Labor as a chief source of human
enjoyment and a ground of respect and honor for its
votaries, I know how little sincerity or depth there
is in the usual Fourth-of-July declamation in behalf
of the dignity of Labor, the nobleness of Labor, and
the like, by men who never did a <span class='it'>bona fide</span> day’s
work with their hands unless absolutely driven to
it, and who would be ashamed of being caught
wheeling a barrow or wielding a spade, unless absolutely
for exercise or pastime; yet, since “Hypocrisy
is the homage which Vice pays to Virtue,”
even this empty glorification of Labor has some
value as a demonstration, if not of what the fortunate
think, at least of what they think they ought to
think. But the tribute paid to Labor in the Great
Exhibition was far deeper and higher than this.
Here were tens of thousands gathered daily to study
and admire the chosen products of the loom, the
forge, the shop, the studio; nine-tenths of them from
no other impulse than that afforded by the pleasure
and instruction found therein. Can all this sink into
the ground and be forgotten? Shall not we, for
instance, who presume ourselves better appreciators
of labor than the gilded aristocracies and squalid
peasantries of Europe, think more of Industrial capacity
since we feel that our country was saved
from disgrace at this grand tournament of Industry
by the genius of Hobbs, of Steers, of Dick, of
McCormick? And shall not the Dukes, the Lords,
the Generals, the Honorables, who met from day to
day to inspect, scrutinize, compare and judge the
rival products of England, France, Germany and
America, in order to award the palm of excellence
to the worthiest in each department—who severally
felt a thrill of pleasure when a countryman bore off
the palm, and a pang of disappointment and chagrin
when none such was found entitled to commendation,—shall
they not henceforth hold in juster esteem
the sphere of Creative Art wherein such trophies
were lost or won? I cannot doubt the beneficent
influence of this Exhibition, both in inspiring workers
with a clearer consciousness of the quiet dignity
of their own sphere, and in diffusing, deepening, a
corresponding appreciation in the minds of others.
If so, who shall say that the Great Exhibition was
held in vain?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet one more lesson: The “World’s Fair” shall
teach us the cheering truth that there is rightfully no
such thing as “Over-Production,” or a glut in the
Labor market. There may be mis-directed, wasted,
useless or worse than useless Industry, like that devoted
to the fabrication of implements of Gaming or
Intoxicating Beverages; but of the Labor and Skill
devoted to the production of whatever is needful, is
tributary to Man’s physical sustenance, intellectual
and moral culture, or material comfort, there are not
and cannot be too much. If all were to insist on
being employed and subsisted in the fabrication of
Hats or of Chintzes, of Pianos or Wall-paper, there
would of course be a glut in that particular department,
but a corresponding deficiency in others. Not
until every family shall be provided with a commodious
and comfortable habitation, and that habitation
amply supplied with food and fuel not only, but with
Clothing, Furniture, Books, Maps, Charts, Globes,
Musical Instruments, and every other auxiliary to
Moral and Intellectual growth as well as to Physical
comfort, can we rationally talk of excessive Production.
There is no such thing as general Over-Production,
and can be none. Immense as the collection
of useful products which the Crystal Palace enfolds,
it is yet but a drop in the bucket when compared
with the far vaster aggregate required to satisfy the
legitimate wants even of Europe alone, though that
is by far the best supplied of the four quarters of the
globe. If each dwelling in wealthy and profusely
manufacturing England alone were to be fitly and
adequately furnished from the existing stores, the
undertaking would very soon dismantle not merely
the Crystal Palace but nearly all the shops and ware-houses
in the Kingdom. There is at no time a lack
of employment because no more needed work remains
undone, but only because the machinery of
Production has not yet been so adjusted and perfected
as to bring the Work and the Workers into their
rightful and fruitful relation. Up and down the
streets of every great city wander thousands after
thousands, seeking work from day to day, and seeking
it in vain, when they themselves would reciprocally
afford a demand for each other’s labor, a market
for each other’s products, if they could but be
placed where they truly belong. Several know how
to spin Cotton, Flax or Wool; others to weave them
all into fabrics; and still others to fashion them into
the garments whereof the unemployed nearly all
stand in need; while other thousands of this hungry
multitude know how to grow the grain, and dig or
cut the fuel, and make the bread, which are essential
to them all. Then why roam this haggard legion
from day to day, from week to week, from month to
month, idle, anxious, famished, tattered, miserable,
and despairing? Do you answer that they lack Industrial
training, and thence productive efficiency?
Then, I tell you, the greater shame to us, practical
workers or in some sense capitalists, who, realizing
their defect and how it crushes them to the earth—realizing,
at least, that they must live somehow, and
that, so long as they may remain idle, their sustenance
must come out of our earnings or our hoards—still
look vacantly, stupidly on, and see them flounder
ever in this tantalizing and ultimately devouring
whirlpool, without stretching forth a hand to rescue
and save them. As individuals, the few can do little
or nothing; but as the State the whole might do
much—every thing—for these poor, perishing stragglers.
As I look out upon their ill-directed, incoherent,
ineffective efforts to find work and bread,
they picture themselves on my mind’s eye as disjointed
fragments and wrecks of humanity—mere
heads, or trunks, or limbs—(oftener “hands”)—torn
apart by some inscrutable Providence, and anxiously,
dumbly awaiting the creative word, the electric
flash, which can alone recombine and restore them
to their proper integrity and practical efficiency.
That word no individual has power to speak; but
Society, the State, the <span class='sc'>Commonwealth</span>, may readily
pronounce it. Let the State but decree—“There
shall be work for every one who will do it; but no
subsistence in pauper idleness for any save the incapable
of working”—and all will be transformed.
Take the orphan from the cellar, the beggar from
the street, the petty filcher from the crowded
wharves, and place them all where they must earn
their bread, and in earning it acquire the capacity to
labor efficiently for themselves—this is a primary
dictate of Public Economy no less than of enlightened
Philanthropy. Palaces vaster and more commodious
than Paxton ever dreamed of might be built
and furnished by the labor which now wears itself
out in vain attempts to find employment—by the application
of faculties now undeveloped or perverted
to evil ends. Only let Society recognize and accept
its duty to find work for all who can find none for
themselves, and the realm of Misery and Despair
will be three-fourths conquered at a blow by Industry,
Thrift and Content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>—But it is time the World’s Fair were closed, or
at least this meager account of it. The year 1852
has sterner work in hand, in presence of which this
wondrous bazaar would seem out of place and incongruous.
Haul down, then, those myriad banners,
now streaming so peacefully from its roof in the
common breeze and flapping each other so lovingly;
they shall full soon be confronted in the red field
where the destinies of Mankind must be decided, the
liberties of Nations lost and won. Roll out these
lumbering cannon, sleeping here side by side so
quietly, uncharged, unmounted, the play-things of
idle boys and the gazing-stock of country clowns,
who wonder what they mean; their iron throats
shall tell a fearful tale amid the steadfast ranks and
charging columns of the Battle Summer before us.
Gray veterans from many lands, leaning on your
rusty swords, and stirring each other’s recollections
of Badajoz, Austerlitz, Leipsic, and Quatre Bras—shake
hands once more and part, for the skies are red
with the gathering wrath of nations, and air-borne
whispers that <span class='sc'>Kossuth</span> is once more free, are troubling
the sleep of tyrants. Ho! Royal Butcher of
Naples! you would not let your subjects visit or enjoy
the Exhibition of 1851; rest assured that they
will bear a part, and you with them, in the grander,
vaster exhibition of 1852. False juggler of the Elysée
Bourbon! beware the ides of May, and learn,
while not too late, that Republican France has other
uses for her armed sons than that of holding sacerdotal
despots on their detested thrones. Kingly perjuror
of Prussia! you have sworn and broken the
last oath to observe and maintain a liberal constitution
to which your abused and betrayed people will ever
hearken from your lips. Prepare for a reckoning in
which perfidy shall no more avail you! Grim Autocrat
of the icy North! the coming summer has work in
store for <span class='it'>your</span> relentless legions, not alone this time
on the Danube, but on the Rhine, the Oder, the Vistula,
as well.—Tear down, then, this fragile structure
of glass and lath! too slight to breast the rugged
shocks of the whirlwind year before us. Ere we
meet again as workers to test the fineness of our rival
fabrics, the strength of our metals, the draft of our
plows, we must vindicate by the mailed hand our
right as men to speak, and think, and be. Before us
lowers the last decisive struggle of the Millions of
Europe for Justice, Opportunity and Freedom; let
not its iron hail appal, its crimson torrents revolt us;
for the Bow of Promise gleams through its lurid
cloud, and the Dove of Peace shall soon be seen
hovering over the assuaging waters, fit harbinger of
a new and more auspicious era for Freedom and enduring
Concord—for Industry and Man!</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE FIRST VOYAGE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>I learned to believe that there is something beyond
the anguish of a lover, or a husband, in the death of
one beloved. I learned to think that an acquired tie
is never so strong as a natural one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole course of life is a series of mistakes—made
and corrected; and this was one of them.
The agony of the bereaved father was far greater
than my own, although I thought that I loved poor
Louise as strongly as it was possible for a husband
to love—although I knew that I loved her now far
more than even before I became her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was not then aware that there is a love beyond
that which I then felt—a love, compared with which,
a father’s, though it may be as enduring, must be
more cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We laid her in the still, still grave. We mingled
our tears together, and returned to the house, now
solitary to us both. We said not a word of future
plans. We made no arrangements. We dealt with
no business. The life and the love that was gone,
was a bond between us, which seemed both to him and
me, unseverable. At first, I gave way to my grief—sat
in the little room that had been hers. Wept
by the side of the bed where she had lain in my
arms, and in the arms of death, and writhed under
the first great disappointment of my earthly hopes.
Oh, how sweet, how beautiful, how pleasant was
her memory, and how bitter, how terrible the
thought that I could never hold her to my heart
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For two days I was brutally selfish—I thought
only of myself, and of my sad, sad loss. In the last
week, I had learned to love her more than I ever
loved her before. It seemed, indeed, as if we had
become one, and that my heart lay dead with hers in
the cold earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was roused from this sort of stupor by the old
woman-servant coming in as I sat there, and saying
in her simple way—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! sir, it is very sad, indeed, for you, but there
is one who has a sadder fate than yours. In heaven’s
name, shake off your sorrow, and go and see him.
You are young, and he is old. You have long years,
and, perhaps, bright days before you. He has nothing
but darkness and solitude between him and the
grave. You have lost one whom you loved well,
but you have time, perhaps, to love again. But he
has lost the only one, and can love no more. Go
and see him, sir. Go and see him; for her whole
heart was in you, and he will think that his child’s
spirit comes back to visit him with her husband. He
has not broken bread,” she added, “since we laid
her on that bed, and there is no sorrow, like an old
man’s sorrow for the death of his only one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I took the good creature’s hands in mine, and
wrung them hard, though I could not speak, and
went forth to seek the bereaved father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found him in his old room, with half-a-dozen
books at his feet—tried, and thrown down upon the
floor. All his activity was gone. He was quiet and
still enough now; but when he saw me, he started
up, and we ran into each other’s arms, as father and
son, weeping very bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We never mentioned her name, and I do not recollect
that, during the whole fortnight I remained
there, he ever alluded to her except upon one
occasion, and that was, when we were on the eve
of parting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, however, let me say how we came to part
at all. Our minds had become a little more calmed.
We sat together, and sometimes conversed. He had
resigned his professorship, took no interest in any
thing which had pleased and amused him before,
and saw no one but myself and one or two old
friends. One day, however, while we were seated
together, not talking, but with our eyes fixed upon
vacancy, and our thoughts resting on the past, the
Chief of Police came in, and spoke to him in a whisper.
The old man’s attention was soon roused, and
as he had a great hatred of secret communications,
he answered and asked questions in a loud tone,
which soon made me aware of the following facts:
that France extending her aggressions far and wide,
and at this time exercising a sort of Dictatorship
over Prussia, under whose Protectorate Hamburgh
was supposed to be, had demanded that all emigrants
who had found refuge in that city should be expelled
or arrested. Resistance was not very easy. Submission
was not very pleasant; and the mode which
the authorities took to escape from their difficulty
was—to inform all emigrants of the demand which
had been made, with a hint that it would be better
for them to deliver Hamburgh from their presence.
The amount of the whole information was, that
there was no longer any safety for me there; that at
any moment I might be arrested at the mandate of
France, and no one in those days could tell what
would be the result.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poor professor was in a terrible slate of distress
and agitation; and I was very much grieved to
leave the father of my poor Louise. But my resolution
was soon taken. The ship in which I had engaged
my passage to America, was still in the port,
and to sail in three days. All my preparations were
rapidly made, and nothing remained but to bid my
good father-in-law adieu. On my marriage day he
had given me a <span class='it'>rouleau</span> of gold Frederics, amounting
to the two thousand dollars he had promised;
but without this, I was comparatively rich; for my
fifty <span class='it'>louis d’ors</span> remained untouched, and I had accumulated
a good many dollars by teaching. I therefore
took him back the <span class='it'>rouleau</span>, and told him I did
not think I had any right to retain it. He would not
receive it, however, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put it up, put it up. Do you think, Louis, I
would rob my dead child? No, no, my dear boy.
You and poor Louise were one. I had hoped that
you would have remained here to close my eyes;
for my time will not be long. But God punishes me
by denying that satisfaction. You must write to me
as soon as you reach the shores of America, and you
shall hear from me very soon after. If I have occasion
to communicate with you before, I will address
my letter to Boston.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the only occasion on which he mentioned
his daughter’s name. His eyes remained tearless,
however, and the words were spoken in that dull,
cheerless, despairing tone, which made me fear,
not without reason, that he would never recover from
the shock he had received. He saw me on board
the vessel, and took leave of me, as a father might
of a son whom he could never behold again. He
was very, very sad; and when he had descended the
ship’s side, and sat in the little boat, he bent down
his eyes, and never lifted them to look at the vessel
which was about to carry me away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was growing dusk when I embarked, and the
ship was to sail about the time of high water, which
was at ten o’clock. I went down therefore at once to
my little, uncomfortable berth, with no great hope of
sleeping, but rather to be out of sight, for there were
feelings in my heart at that moment, which I did not
wish exposed to the eyes of others. I was weary,
however, and exhausted; for I had slept but very little
during the last three days, and after lying in sad stillness,
shut up in the close, evil-smelling cabin for about
an hour, I fell into the most profound slumber that I
ever recollect to have obtained. I heard nothing, I
knew nothing; and when I woke, the broad day was
looking at me through a round, thick glass window,
like an eye, in the side of the cabin; and I could
hear a strange sort of rushing, gurgling noise close at
my head, giving me the first intimation that there
was nothing but that frail plank between me and the
wide, deep sea. A negro, in a white jacket, with
his sleeves turned up from his large-boned, sinewy,
black arms, was laying a table in the middle of the
cabin, as if for the morning meal, and putting out my
head, I asked him where we were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He grinned at me with his white teeth, saying—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t tell, massa. No post-house in middle of
sea. You glad of your dinner, I reckon, habin’ had
no breakfas’. You come and eat good dinner. Keep
him down if you can. He, he, he.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not feel myself the least disposed to be sick,
however, and the ship seemed to be going with so
smooth and easy a motion, that I felt very sure for
that day at least, I should escape the infliction
which most young voyagers have to endure. I rose
and dressed myself, but had hardly completed my
toilet, when my friend, the negro, made his appearance
with an enormous piece of roast beef. He
then brought in a great tureen of pea-soup, and a dish
of potatoes; and such was our fare almost every day
during the voyage, with the slight, and not very
pleasant variation of strongly salted beef, instead of
fresh, which took place when we had been about six
days at sea. Such was the provision of an American
packet-ship in those days. Hunger, however, they
say is good sauce, and I must confess that I was ravenous.
When the dinner was served, the captain
of the vessel came down, with his only other passenger,
one of the most extraordinary looking beings
I ever saw. She was a Madame Du Four; an emigrant
like myself; dressed in the fashion of the court
of Louis the Fifteenth, with a robe of stiff brocade
silk, not very clean, and a petticoat, shown in front,
of green satin. She had strong-marked aquiline
features, very keen dark eyes, and shaggy brows, was
enormously tall, and had also added to her height by
a sort of tower upon her head of most extraordinary
construction, consisting, I fancy, of a cushion, over
which her hair, well powdered, was carried on all
sides, with a lace cap, and coquelicot ribbons surmounting
the whole. She was highly rouged, and
painted white also; but those female vanities did not
prevent her from having a somewhat fierce and masculine
look, which was not at all softened by a sort
of finikin <span class='it'>minauderie</span> of manner with which it contrasted
strongly. On the first day, too, I could not
help thinking when she moved across the cabin, or
walked about the deck, that I detected a pair of Hessian
boots under her enormous petticoats. On the
following day, however, she had shoes, buckles, and
silk stockings. Our dinner passed pleasantly enough,
though the bluff American Captain could hardly get
on with his meal for laughter whenever Madame Du
Four opened her mouth. The fun he had out of her
during the passage was quite as good as double passage
money, although I must acknowledge she spoke
English very well, and therefore it was not at her
language that he laughed. She was exceedingly
agreeable, too, notwithstanding her oddities, had an
immense fund of information, and seemed to have
traveled a great deal. Like all Frenchwomen she
had great curiosity, and never rested till she had
wormed out of me, my whole history, with the exception
of that part which referred to my poor Louise—a
subject too sacred to be touched upon by me.
To my surprise, and not altogether to my satisfaction—for
it made me accuse myself of indiscretion—she
took down the name of Father Bonneville and Madame
de Salins, and I endeavored to get in return,
some information respecting herself. But there she
was proof against all enquiries; and I could only
discover that she had friends or relations in
Louisiana.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner I went upon the deck, and there the
principal part of my time was spent during the voyage,
whether the weather was fine or foul; for the
cabin was close and miserable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have heard men, and read books, expressing the
highest enthusiasm and admiration of the sea, but I
suppose I am very unimaginative; for I never could
discover any thing in it to excite my admiration, except
perhaps a certain degree of sublimity, which
always attaches to vastness. As we passed along
over the bosom of the waters, with one unvarying
expanse around us, that ocean about which men rave
so much, seemed to me nothing but one great, dull,
brown heaving mass, very unpleasant to the eye,
and exceedingly monotonous. As the sun went
down, however, the prospect was a little varied on
that first day, by the long, bright line of ruby light
which he cast from the horizon to the ship; but except
twice, we never had the honor of seeing his
face in the evening; though once or twice he broke
out about mid-day. Generally the sky was covered
with clouds, and very often a thick mist enveloped
us, exciting greatly the indignation of the captain,
who seemed to think he had a right to clear weather.
I was not even treated to a storm, though, occasionally,
it blew what the captain called half a gale, and
then the great, greenish brown, drugget-looking thing
that surrounded us was tossed up into some very
uncomely and disagreeable billows. Happily for
myself I was not in the slightest degree sea-sick,
which raised me greatly in the opinion of the captain,
who used to wink knowingly at meal times
toward the cabin of good Madame Du Four, who
never appeared in rough weather, and say, with a
laugh, “The old woman is laid up on the locker, I
guess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of three weeks one of the sea phenomena
which I had often heard described, occurred
as we were passing some fishing banks. It was
night, and the sky was very cloudy, but the whole
sea was in a blaze of light, as if the Milky-Way had
been transferred to its bosom. Every wave that
passed was loaded with stars, and not only the
wake of the ship, but long lines in different directions
where the sea was agitated, seemed all on fire.
This continued for many hours, and I have seldom
seen any thing more marvelously beautiful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here, too, we saw a great number of small fishing
vessels—the first ships of any kind that we had met
with. A whale or two also came in sight, and long
troops of white porpoises; but nothing else occurred
to enliven us during the whole passage; and I must
confess, that I cannot conceive any thing more dull,
heavy and uninteresting, taken as a whole, than a
voyage across the wide Atlantic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certainly my spirits did not rise during the passage.
I had made up my mind to write and read a
great deal, and to occupy my thoughts as far as possible
with indifferent subjects; but I did nothing of
the kind, and I have remarked since that a ship is
the idlest place in the whole universe. Nobody
seems to do any thing but the sailors, and they nothing
more than they are obliged to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length, oh blessed sight! just as day was beginning
to break we perceived a light-boat, and the captain
announced that we were on the coast of America.
I never was so rejoiced at any thing in my
life, especially when, a few minutes after, I heard
him order a gun to be fired for a pilot. But whether
in punishment at my repining, or in order that I
might have a full and competent knowledge of the
sea, before I had done with it, the cannon had hardly
roared out its first call for a pilot, when the wind chopped
round suddenly from the west with a little south
in it, and in a quarter of an hour was blowing a heavy
gale off the coast. For four long, tedious days we
continued struggling against this merciless enemy,
in no little danger, as I understood afterward, and
during the whole of that time I was enlivened by
hearing the plaintive voice of Madame Du Four exclaiming
to herself, “<span class='it'>Oh, mon Dieu! je vais mourir</span>,”
together with other sounds, not nearly so euphonious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length, however, we got into the beautiful port
of Boston; and as we sailed peacefully amongst the
blue islands, up came Madame Du Four, painted,
patched and brocaded, and as brisk as a bee.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>A NEW WORLD AND NEW OLD ACQUAINTANCE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The captain of the vessel kindly took me to a
small inn, not very far from the port; where I got
tolerable accommodation. My first task was to
seek for a warm bath; for my long voyage of more
than five weeks duration, made me feel as if I had
been pickled. It was with considerable difficulty
that I procured what I wanted; for Boston was not
famous for baths in those days. I succeeded at
length, indeed, and then dined very well, though with
less appetite than had savored the coarser provisions
at sea. No one can tell with what satisfaction I
looked forward to resting in the good, steady bed
which my room contained; but the sea had not done
with me yet, and for two whole nights, as soon as I
lay down, every thing began to move with me and
swim about just as if I was still upon the ocean. I
could hardly persuade myself that the house was not
afloat. The next morning, while at breakfast, one
of the black waiters came in and told me that a gentleman
had called to see me, and on ordering him to
be admitted, a tall, good-looking man, of about
thirty-five was ushered in. His face was familiar
to me, though I could not recollect where I had seen
it before, and he was dressed with great neatness
and precision, partly in black, partly in drab, with a
thick cravat round his neck, and a pair of Hessian
boots drawn up to his knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur De Lacy,” he said, taking my hand,
“I am glad to see you in America. Allow me to
congratulate you on your safe arrival.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thanked him, told him that he had the advantage of
me in knowing my name, and begged to be told whom
I had the honor of addressing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waiter had, by this time, quitted the room;
but my visitor still took the precaution of putting his
lips close to my ear, while he said, “Madame Du
Four—at present Monsieur Du Four, if you please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Heaven!” I exclaimed, “what could have
induced you to adopt so strange a travestie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The very simple motive of concealing myself as
best I might,” he replied. “In regard to yourself,
and many of the other emigrants, the good people of
Hamburgh had the choice given them by their tyrannical
masters, either to arrest or to expel. In
my case the order was simply to arrest, and send me
off to France as a prisoner. They were ready to
wink at any evasion, however, and to the eyes of
French spies my great-grandmother’s petticoats, like
charity, covered a multitude of sins. Now, Monsieur
De Lacy, I think I can be of assistance to you;
for I have had a great deal to do with emigrants,
am in continual communication with them in various
parts of the world, and probably can obtain for
you information regarding the friends you are so
anxious to hear of. Some of them, I think, are now
in Russia, where I have passed a good deal of my
time, under the favor and protection of that mild and
excellent potentate, the Emperor Paul. As it is well
known, however, that he is not long for this life, I
thought it might be as well to be absent at the accession
of a new sovereign, and therefore betook
myself to Hamburgh. However, I have still friends
and connections in Russia, as well as in many other
parts of the world, and I think if you will let me
know where you are to be found, I can obtain for
you information which may be satisfactory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My plans were all unsettled, and I knew not
where I might go, or what I might do. I was at
this time richer than I had ever been in my life before,
but I knew that my little store was not inexhaustible,
and I resolved to seek speedily for some
employment. Without telling my new friend, then,
the exact state of my finances, I consulted him where
I should go, and what I should do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can stay here in Boston,” he replied, “as
long as the weather is warm, and probably may find
some employment; for you have a rich, active and
intelligent population; but don’t remain in the winter;
for it is the coldest city in the universe. In point
of temperature, St. Petersburg is comparatively a
terrestrial paradise. However you can receive letters
wherever you may be by having them directed
here, if you will take the precaution of always sending
your address to the post-office. I do not mean to
say that they will come to you rapidly; because of
course every thing goes on with less regularity and
certainty, under a republican than under a monarchical
government. In republics, where place and power
depends upon mere popular favor, the greater part
of the business of the State is carried on by inexperienced
men, for, generally speaking, each public
officer is kicked out before he can gain the experience
necessary for his office—just as a tradesman,
without capital, does all his work by apprentices.
There are exceptions of course—men who get such
hold of public confidence, that even faction cannot
shake them—but these are rare, and to have work
half done and ill done is part of the compensation to
be paid for great rapidity of progress and general
diffusion of comfort. But I am digressing. You
have nothing to do, Monsieur De Lacy, but to leave
your address at the post-office, and you shall hear
from me as soon as I obtain intelligence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He added a good many of very judicious instructions
as to my conduct in Boston, where he certainly
must have been before, although he did not say so;
and he left me, I confess, with a much more pleasant
impression of his male than his female character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not anticipate much, it is true, from his promises,
and perhaps did not feel quite so sure of his
sincerity as I ought to have done. I suppose there are
some professions and some occasions in which charlatanism
is absolutely necessary; but I think we
rarely respect the people who practice it; and the
impression produced by his appearance in the character
of Madame Du Four, was never, and never
will be effaced from my memory. I could not get
rid of the ludicrous recollections, and we rarely expect
much service from people who make us laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Letters of introduction to persons in Boston, I had
none; and I suffered for several days all the inconveniences
which a stranger, without personal friends
in a city, feels at his first residence. The solitariness,
as it were, pressed upon me, and the more people
I met in the crooked and narrow streets, made
me only feel the more solitary. Of Monsieur Du
Four I saw no more at that time, and I began to
think of removing to some other town, where the people
were not so cold and repulsive, when I suddenly
made an acquaintance which greatly changed the
current of affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day as I was walking along the streets, I
thought I might as well purchase some French
books, of which I had only one with me, in order
that I might not quite forget my own language. I
entered therefore a great bookseller’s shop—dingy
and dull enough it was, in all conscience—and asked
for one or two works which I named.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although it may seem to have no connection with
this part of my history, yet I must say something of
my personal appearance at this time, as I am convinced
it had some effect upon the events that followed.
I was now within quarter of an inch of six
feet high, robust in frame, from much exercise, tanned
almost a mahogany color by exposure to the sea
air, and with a moustache long and thick for my
age. My hair had been suffered to grow very long,
and floated wildly in its unshorn curls, and I was
dressed in deep and new mourning of a foreign cut.
Thus in the streets of Boston, I had something at
least to distinguish me from the citizens of the place,
where no one wore moustaches at all, and most of
them had their hair still thickly powdered, and tied
in queue, while those who had not, wore it as closely
cut as the ears of a terrier dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In asking for the books, I spoke in a grave, and perhaps
somewhat abrupt manner; for the death of my
poor Louise, had left upon me a sort of carelessness of
men’s opinions, and a lack of the desire to please,
which is rare in youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shopman answered at once in a somewhat
flippant manner that he guessed they had none of
them; and I replied in the same cold and imperative
tone in which I had first spoken, that I would trouble
him to do something more than guess—to make sure;
whether the books were there or not, and if not,
whether they could be procured for me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon you are from the old country,” said the
man, with the most good humored impertinence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is nothing to you, my friend,” I replied.
“We will reckon when I have got the books.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I calculate you had better speak to our
boss,” said the shopman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A very good calculation,” I replied, “if you
mean your master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I h’aint got a master,” rejoined the man, with a
look of considerable indignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well then,” I said, “let me speak with any one
who supplies the place of a master, and who is
master at all events of the shop, if he is not of the
shopman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you might have called it store, stranger,”
said my friend; but as by this time I had taken up
a book from the counter and begun to read, he went
away to call his “boss,” as he termed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment after, from a little dingy den behind,
came out a neat, dapper little man, with a very
straight-cut, snuff colored coat, fastened with a hook
and eye high up upon the chest, in order to permit
the liberal extension of a very smart flowered waistcoat,
and a stomach, somewhat too large in its proportions,
shaped like the back of a mandolin. Energy,
activity, and acuteness, were in all his movements
and sparkled in his bright black eye; and, roused by
his step, I could perceive that as he approached, he
scanned me from head to foot with a rapidity truly
marvelous. Before I knew what I was about he was
shaking hands with me, and before I could ask for
my books, he was asking me innumerable questions—who
I was—where I came from—what my name
was—what was my profession—how old I was—whether
I intended to stay long in Boston, and—what
I thought of America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was strongly inclined to laugh, but I was out of
the habit of laughing now, and I answered gravely:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Order in all things, if you please, sir. Are you
what this person calls the ‘boss,’ or what I should
call the master of this shop—or store?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, never mind him,” replied the new comer.
“He is from another state, and doesn’t half understand
English. It’s only in Bost’n I guess that
there’s any thing like English to be found in all the
universal world. I’m the master of this store, sir,
and a very pretty little considerable quantity of literature
you will find therein, I guess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well then, to reply to your questions,” I said,
“I am a stranger in this city. I come from a distant
part of the world. My name is my own, for any
thing I know to the contrary. I am of any profession
that suits me at the moment. I am somewhere
between twenty and thirty, I have no notion how
long I shall stay in Boston, and having only seen two
square miles of America, I do not think the taster is
decisive of the cheese.—Now, sir, will you have
the goodness to tell me about the books I want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Capital, capital, capital!” cried my new friend.
“I guess such answers would pose half the men in
Congress. We Yankees are terrible question askers
it must be acknowledged. It’s a way we have, and
not a bad way either; for if we get an answer, we
are all the better for it, and if we get none, we can
do very well without it. Now, sir, you’re just the
man we want: I can see that in a minute. We
haven’t had any thing new in Bost’n for six months—that
is, since the giantess, and the horse with three
tails. They did very well, but we want something
literary now, and if you chose to come out with a
lecture, or a book, or a pamphlet, or a sermon against
the Trinity, or something very racy upon democracy
and federalism—take which side you will; it’s all
the same to me—or even in defense of the old
country, showing that we are all rebels and traitors
and ought to have been hanged long ago, it’s sure
to answer—it will sell, sir,—it will pay—it will bring
in the dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something so perfectly good-humored
in my new friend, that I could not be at all cross,
even though I might not quite enter into his notions.
I was obliged to inform him, however, that I had
never given lectures, written books, pamphlets, or
sermons. That I was not an Englishman. That I
was not well acquainted with American history, and
had no idea whether his friends and himself deserved
to be hanged or not—though I confessed I rather
thought not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was very pertinacious, however, and suggested
a dozen different courses of acting for me, being in
truth at that moment in desperate need himself of a
stranger to supply the place of a literary man who
had absconded, and knowing the dire need in which
the city of Boston stood of some “new thing,” to fill
the yawning void left by the giantess and the horse
with three tails. I began to fancy, as he went on, that
amongst all the pearls he was throwing before me, I
might find one which suited my own purpose, and at
length it was determined that I should write a little
book for him, which he would immediately bring
out in what he guessed was the very best possible
style. Our arrangements were soon made, though,
as I found afterward, he agreed to pay me about
one-third of the sum which I ought to have received.
That book, however, not only served to put a small
sum into my pocket, but also to spread my fame, and
to occupy my thoughts. I was very glad of the latter;
for the moment I sat down by myself in my inn, I
fell into sad reveries, and I wished very much to let
time do his work of consoling by those slow and almost
insensible steps through which he best effects
his objects. The subject, the treatment, was all discussed
in less than half an hour; for my friend, the
bookseller, had very definite ideas, and knew to a
nicety what would sell, and what would not. While
we were still talking over these things, several gentlemen
entered the shop, to whom the bookseller—now
in possession of my name—introduced me as
the celebrated Monsieur De Lacy. Thus I obtained
occupation for the next six weeks, and acquaintance
with some of the pleasantest persons I ever met with
in my life; and the next morning I saw announcement
in the public prints that Monsieur De Lacy, the
well known Vendeean chief had arrived in Boston,
followed by an apocripha twice as long as the book
of Tobit, regarding the bloody battles I had fought,
and the victories I had obtained in a district within
which I had never set my foot. All this was based
upon a deep scar on my cheek, which I had received
from the heel of an Austrian soldier, as I lay upon
the ground in the streets of Zurich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although I smiled, while reading this account, the
idea of being or having been, one of the actors in the
great and extraordinary struggle in La Vendee was
very pleasant to me. I thought of it a good deal, and
although I had fancied some weeks before that
America was the country, of all others, to afford
me a peaceful and happy refuge, I now began to
long for a return to Europe, to take part in the
active scenes which were going on in my native
land.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>A LOSS AND A RECOVERY.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>I need not dwell upon my course of life during the
next few months. Most men have experienced what
it is to make one’s way in a strange town, and I do not
think it would be very interesting to any one, if I
were to give a detailed account of the process of
being made a factitious lion of. My good friend the
bookseller would have it so in my case: he wanted
a lion at that moment: there was no other material
at hand, and he made me into a lion. Not a newspaper
did I open, without seeing my name in it. If
I went to look at Faneuil Hall, or strolled from Court
Street to the Common, it was sure to be recorded
for the public, and by the mere act of iteration the
public were driven by seeing my name every day,
to think I must be somebody. But the worst of this
lion system is, that it is not always very easy to shake
off your lion skin when you are tired of it. I confess I
began to be weary of seeing my name in the columns
of the journals, and at first I was inclined to correct
all the various lies that were told about me, and to
assure the people of Boston, in print, that I had never
done fifty things I was reported to have done, and
never intended to do fifty other things that were
sketched out for me by the fertile imagination of
various editors. A kind and judicious friend, however,
advised me to refrain; and as this little sort of
false celebrity obtained for me a great number of
most delightful acquaintances, I was obliged to take
the good with the bad, and receive much hospitality
and kindly and instructive communion, as some compensation
for being made to dance grotesquely in the
public prints. I lost no opportunity, however, of
denying, in private, all that was said about me in
public, of telling all my friends in the city that I was
not the great man, or the celebrated character I was
represented—that I had never been in La Vendee
in my life, and had never even seen a battle but that
of Zurich. I must do them the justice to say also,
that these confessions did not diminish their kindness
in the least; and that when they found me to be
a very plain, humble person, they were, perhaps,
more hospitable and friendly than before. The
writing of my book was favorable to me in all respects.
It was but a poor affair, it is true; but it
saved my little fortune, filled the pockets of the
bookseller—for its success was ridiculous, in consequence
of all the Charlitanism which was used
before it appeared—and it did still more for me, by
weaning my thoughts from the one deep, sorrowful
subject of contemplation, which otherwise would
have engrossed my mind continually. The autumn
was coming on rapidly when it appeared; the woods
around were glowing with colors such as I never in
my life beheld in Nature’s robe before; and partly to
get away from the crowds of a great city, partly to
enjoy the loveliness of the scenery at a little distance
from Boston, I used to wander forth early in the
morning, and often not return till nightfall. I used
sometimes, too, to call at the post-office and inquire
for letters, with very little expectation of receiving
any. Who would write to me, unless it were good
Professor Haas or Monsieur Du Four? but from the
former I thought there had been but little time to
hear, and upon the promises of the latter I placed but
little reliance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, however, a thick letter was handed to
me, with my address written on coarse German paper,
with a black seal, and bearing the post-mark of
Hamburgh. The handwriting, however, was not
that of the good old professor; and I opened it with
considerable apprehension, thinking that he must be
ill, and must have employed some other hand to
write for him. It was worse than I expected. Professor
Haas was dead; and the letter was from his
old friend the notary, who had drawn up the marriage
contract between Louise and myself. He informed
me of the fact of my friend’s death, in brief, formal
terms, and then went on to state that Professor Haas
had left the whole bulk of his property to me, naming
as executors, one of his fellow professors and the
notary himself, with directions to sell his house, and
all that he possessed, and remit the money to a great
banking-house in London for my benefit. I thought
this a somewhat strange proceeding till I read further.
I then found that the professor, who had always
entertained the most profound horror for Revolutionists,
had, during his latter days, and especially
his sickness, become impressed with a notion that
the French Republicans would sooner or later get
possession of Hamburgh, and plunder the whole city.
Ample directions were added to enable me to dispose
of the money in any way I pleased, and more
than one half of the paper was occupied with a long
statement of accounts, which I did not even try to
understand. The sum already remitted to England,
however, was large, and enough to put me at my
ease for life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First impressions are, I suppose, always the most
generous ones; and however great might have been
the relief at any other moment to know that the
means of subsistence were no longer to depend upon
the caprice of Fortune, the intelligence afforded me
but little consolation, when coupled with the death
of my poor friend. I was very, very sad. The last
earthly tie between myself and my poor Louise
seemed gone; and all the painful memories connected
with the last days of her life, revived as darkly and
gloomily as ever. I took no steps in regard to the
property. I did not even answer the notary’s letter;
but day after day I walked out over the curious
broken ground, and cedar-covered hills to the south
and west of Boston, meditating sadly upon the past.
At the face of nature I used to look from time to
time, finding I know not what, of similarity between
the fading aspect of the autumn-woods and the
withering away of my own hopes and happiness.
But I looked little at man when he fell in my way,
and many a time felt half angry when a fellow walker
on the same road gave me good day, or stopped to
ask me the hour. There were very few human
habitations in that direction at the time; and one solitary
public house, about four miles from the city, I
used to pass with my eyes always bent upon the
ground. I know not what induced me to raise my
eyes toward it one day, as I was walking along,
somewhat more slowly than usual—for the weather
had become suddenly sultry, in what they call the
Indian Summer. Perhaps it was that my eye caught
an indistinct sight of some one sitting under the
veranda—an old man, very shabbily dressed in
brown. I could not see his features, for I was at
the distance of more than a hundred yards, and I
only took a casual glance. But as I returned by the
same road, the old man was still sitting there; and a
young girl of twelve or thirteen years of age was standing
by, talking to him, and offering him something
in a cup. In my morose selfishness, I was going on
without any further notice, when suddenly he took
the girl’s arm, and rose up feebly, looking straight
toward me. A strange feeling of recognition instantly
seized upon me, and I turned sharply toward
the house, with doubt in my mind, but certainty in
my heart—a contrast that takes place more often
than people imagine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I got near, doubt vanished. It was Father
Bonneville; but as doubt disappeared with me, it
seemed to increase with him, for it would seem that,
although he had been very ill, I was far more
changed than he was. Something in my gait and
figure had struck him; but when he saw a broad and
powerful young man, instead of the stripling who
had been separated from him at Zurich, he could
hardly believe in my identity, and did not feel quite
sure till his hand was grasped in mine. I never saw
the poor man so much agitated in all the many
scenes we had passed through together. His usual
calm placidity abandoned him entirely; and for a
moment or two he wept with feelings which I am
sure were not all unpleasant. I sat down beside him,
while the girl ran into the house to tell her father,
who was the landlord thereof, that the French gentleman
had found a friend; and during her absence
he told me that he had been living there for the last
six weeks, almost on charity. He had sought me
he said, far and near, and at length, partly from some
preconception of the course I was likely to take,
partly from some false information he had received
in Holland, had concluded I had sailed for America,
within four months after the battle of Zurich. He
had in consequence embarked for New York, and
had at that time made many efforts to make me acquainted
with his arrival. For six months after
reaching the shores of America, he had continued to
receive supplies of money; but suddenly they had
ceased, he said, and then for some time he had supported
himself by teaching. His scholars fell off,
however, and he was advised to try Boston; but his
means were too small for the hotels or boarding-houses
of that city, and feeling himself ill, he had
come out to that remote place, both for purer air and
greater economy. His money lasted but a fortnight,
and he had explained to the landlord his situation.
The good man—for he really was a good man—told
him not to make himself uneasy, and proposed that
he should teach his two daughters for his board until
he was well enough to return to Boston again. But
poor Father Bonneville soon became too ill, either
to teach or to rise from his bed, and then all the native
kindness of the people came forth. His two
little pupils nursed him, he told me, as if he had been
a parent. Their father supplied him with every
thing that he required, and brought a physician, at
his own expense, to see him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the third time I have left my room,” he
said, “and they are still as kind as ever, though I
have been a great burden to them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No burden at all, my good man,” said the landlord,
who was by this time standing by our side.
“It’s but little good one can do in this world, and
God forbid we shouldn’t do it when we can. I am
very happy, however, he has found one of his friends
at last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has found one,” I said, shaking the landlord
by the hand, “to whom he has been more than a
father, and who will never forget your kindness to
him. I thank God that I am now in a situation to
say, he shall never at least know what want is
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well,” said the landlord, “that is all very
well. But you had better come into the house and
talk it out there. We are just going to dinner, and
there’s as good a chowder as ever was made. He
told my girl he couldn’t eat just now, but he’s got
his appetite back now, I guess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We went in; and I sat down with them to their
plain meal with more satisfaction than if I had been
invited to a prince’s table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although my good old friend was exceedingly
anxious to hear all my own adventures since we
parted, I contrived to make him tell all that had occurred
to him, which amounted to little more than
what I have already stated. He had been detained
by the Austrians, he said, for nearly two months,
had been sent to Milan, and put in prison there, but
in other respects had been well treated, and at length
liberated, on its being made clear that he was a
French emigrant with no political character. He
hurried through the details, in order to get at my
history, and then said, with a look of parental affection,
“But now tell me, my dear Louis, what has
happened to you since we met last? How comes
that scar upon your cheek? Where have you been
staying? And why are you in such deep mourning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last words sent all the color from my cheek.
I could feel the blood rush away as if to fill my heart
too full, and I shook my head sadly, saying, “Do not
ask me about that just now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I then related to him all that had occurred previous
to my arrival in Hamburgh; how, after I had shot
the man who was going to murder him, I had turned
back to assist Lavater; how I had been knocked
down and trodden under feet by the Austrian soldiers,
and afterward carried to the hospital; I then
told him that I had suffered from poverty as well as
himself, and that I had begged my way to the north
of Germany. “That is all over now,” I added,
“and I trust that we shall never know such days
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you two have had a pretty hard life of it,”
said the good landlord—for we had been speaking in
English all the time, so that he understood us. “You
were great people in your own country, I dare say;
and that made it all the harder for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not very great people,” I replied, “but very
comfortable, and very happy, till we were driven
forth for no fault of our own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I judged from what I saw of good Father Bonneville
at this time, that he had not yet sufficiently recovered
to return to Boston, and I therefore left him
where he was for the night, promising to see him
early on the following day. Although engaged to
go out to a party in the city, I remained at home
that evening pondering upon my course of action. I
read over again, and more attentively, the letter from
the notary, answered it, and signed the accounts,
although to say truth, I knew little of the affairs to
which they referred. I then considered long, and
somewhat anxiously, two plans which naturally
suggested themselves to my mind. The first was,
to go to England, receive the sum which there
awaited me, and establish myself with Father Bonneville
in that country. But strange to say I had a dislike
to the idea of visiting England. Father Bonneville,
in all our wanderings, had shown no desire to take
refuge in a land where so many other emigrants had
found safety and met with hospitality. Views prejudicial
to England had been widely circulated amongst
the inhabitants of all those countries which entertain
feelings and jealousies against Great Britain,
on account of her calm, steady, and, at the same
time, extraordinary progress in arts, sciences, commerce
and arms. Even the very Swiss, while they
admired and applauded it, did not like England; and
the isolation of her geographical position seemed to
affect the character of her inhabitants as well as her
policy and her interests. Like every one who has
never been in England, I conceived the most false
and inferior idea of her people, her views, and her
very aspect. I imagined that it was a cold, bleak,
ungenial country, everlastingly overhung by fogs,
with the sun rarely, if ever, apparent, and deriving
its great wealth and importance solely from its commerce.
I believed the people to be haughty, self-sufficient
and repulsive, unsocial in all their habits,
and although occasionally generous and benevolent,
actuated upon all ordinary occasions by motives of
self-interest and commercial selfishness. I had heard
a great deal at Hamburgh, in the society of the professors
there, of her treatment of scientific and literary
men, of the cold neglect they experience, of
their exclusion from all that forms the ambition of
others, of the honors paid to them when dead, and
the misery to which they were subjected while
living. The old maxim still rang in my ears, that
France was the country for a literary man to live in,
and England for him to die in; and I believed that
there really could be very little good or generous in
a nation which displayed such cold neglect and bitter
injustice toward those who labored to elevate the
human mind, and whose names form no insignificant
part of her glory. I was now, I thought, in a beautiful
and youthful country, comprising within itself
every climate and every soil, offering opportunity
and encouragement to every one, where thought and
action were free, where progress was rapid beyond
conception, where no invidious distinctions existed,
where competence, if not wealth, was the sure reward
of exertion—a land of youth, of hope, and
energy. I thought of England, in short, as England
was at that time conventionally represented on the
continents of Europe and of America; not as I knew it
to be. It is not wonderful therefore, that in the end I
determined to remain in the country where I then
was, and to send for the funds which had been invested
in London, without visiting Great Britain
myself. It must be remembered at the same time,
that Napoleon was now in the plenitude of his
power, commanding sovereigns and dictating to nations,
and that England stood single-handed against
a world in arms. There was little hope therefore
that I could aid even in the slightest degree in relieving
France from the tyranny under which she
groaned, and that seemed to me the only object worthy
of desire, which could lead me once more to traverse
the Atlantic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I laid down my head upon my pillow that
night, my determination was fully taken to remain
in the United States; and with my fondness for
visionary prospects, I drew a pleasant picture of a
New England farm, with competence and literary
ease, and rural occupations, diversified by those
sports of the field which I had enjoyed so much in
other years. How soon, and how speedily, all such
visions melted away; all such resolutions came to
an end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I rose the following morning, carried my letter to
the post-office, and carelessly asked if there were
any communications for me. The good man with
spectacles, answered yes, and from a great bundle,
took out a letter for which he demanded a high postage.
It came from New Orleans, and contained but
a few words to the following effect.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Faithful to my promise, I have made every inquiry,
Monsieur De Lacy, for the friends in regard
to whose fate you were anxious when I saw you.
Of the good Father Bonneville I have been able to
obtain no intelligence; but Madame de Salins and
Mademoiselle, her daughter, are now in London,
and perhaps a letter addressed to them at <span class='it'>numero</span> 3
Swallow Street, may obtain for you information regarding
Monsieur De Bonneville.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Accept the assurances of the constant consideration
and regard of</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;'>Your devoted,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;'><span class='sc'>Charles Du Four</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>What was it that possessed me! What was it in
the sight of those few words which altered in a moment
all my determinations? I speak sincerely—and
I looked into my own heart at the time, and have
done so often since—and I believe that it was solely
the awakening of old associations—the revival of the
memories of happy youthful days. I pictured Father
Bonneville, and Mariette and myself all living
together again, as we had done in those happy days
on the banks of the Rhine, and my teaching Mariette
to read and write, totally forgetting that she was no
longer a little girl of six or seven years old, and of
our having a pretty house of our own, and a nice
garden, and spending our days in pleasantness and
peace. We are all dream-led in this world, and this
was but one of the pleasantest dreams of my life,
come back upon me to show how much the visions
of imagination can effect against the realities of reason.
I left the door of the post-office, where I read
the letter, with my resolution fixed—and now unchangeable—to
visit England as soon as Father Bonneville
was well enough to undertake the voyage.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>A NEW LAND.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>I was on the deck about half-past six ante meridian,
on as fine a morning as ever broke upon the
world. We had encountered very severe gales,
varying from the north-west, at which they first
began, almost all round the compass. I could not
think what was in the weather. Its only object
seemed to be, to battle the sea and to fret the Atlantic.
One glorious thunder-storm had diversified the monotony
of the voyage, and I shall never forget either
the grand masses of cloud which rose up in the
splendor of the evening from the sea, like the purple
mountains of a new land, rising under the wand of
an enchanter, or the vivid flashes of the lightning as
they blazed around us during the live-long night.
The thunder, I must confess, was far less loud and
sublime than I have heard it on land, where rocks
and mountains and forests sent it roaring through
innumerable echoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this storm succeeded much calmer weather,
and on the morning which I now speak of, the vessel
with all sail set, and a favorable wind, could barely
reckon five knots an hour. There was a soft and
sleepy splendor about the sky as the sun rose—a
bright softness of atmosphere, almost misty—which
received and retained long a tint from the rosy coloring
of the sun’s early rays.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My approach to the Coast of America, after the
first voyage I had ever made, had greatly disappointed
me. Long, flat lines, like low islands in a river,
were not the contrast one anticipated after sailing
over the vast Atlantic; but as we now bore onward, I
suddenly beheld upon the left, a number of immense
rocky masses, of a pale violet color, with the sea,
even in that calm weather, breaking furiously upon
them, and not long after, on the right, some high,
precipitous rocks, detached from what seemed to be
the main land, and forming as I imagined the point
of a peninsula, sheltering the beautiful bay into which
we seemed slowly gliding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I asked the helmsman what these two objects
were; and he replied—“The Scilly Islands and the
Needles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This then was England—the England of which all
the world had heard so much—the fortress of the
deep: slow to engage in warfare: resolute when
once engaged: unconquerable: inexpugnable: with
a vitality that defied time and change: with a progress
which had something sublime in its calm, fearless,
equable march. This was the England which
had twice produced the conquerors of France, which
had subjected a world to the influence of its science
and its literature; whose sails were on every sea;
whose arms were in each hemisphere; whose name
was a redoubted passport in every land; whose language
was spoken on the coasts of every continent.
This then was England! And those rocky cliffs,
and rugged peaks, in their grand, silent majesty,
seemed to me the image and the emblem of the
people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we slowly sailed on, keeping very near the
coast, to get the most favorable wind, and under the
directions of a pilot, steering in and out amongst
banks, which added the interest of some peril to the
general charm of the scenery, the aspect of the country
softened. Beautiful green slopes, rich woods,
gay looking towns, a picturesque country-house here
and there, and a group of cottages crowning a bold
cliff or nested at its foot, were seen all along the line
of coast, and the very first sight of that country filled
the mind with ideas of home comfort, and sweet domestic
peace, and the rich prosperity of an industrious,
law-fearing people, and an equable, but firm
government, more strongly than the aspect of any
other land I had ever seen. Oh! how all my prepossessions
vanished before that sight—and when about
nine o’clock I persuaded Father Bonneville to come
upon deck, as we were proceeding calmly up a
channel between two lands, both plainly visible, the
good old man would hardly believe his eyes that this
fair, sunshiny, beautiful country, was the England
of which he had so often heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is the most extraordinary fact I know, that no
foreigner whom I have ever met with, who has
never visited England, (and comparatively few of
those who have,) has had the slightest idea of what
the land really is, or what are its inhabitants. A
Frenchman knows more of what is passing beyond
the equator, than he knows of what exists on the
other side of the narrow British channel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The slow progress we made, which was not increased
in speed in the least by the cursing and
swearing of the pilot—one of the most blasphemous
fellows I ever met with—rendered it late in the evening
before we approached Portsmouth, whither we
were bound to deliver a large cargo of various sorts
of wood, to be employed experimentally, in the works
of the great naval arsenal there established. It was
some occasion of rejoicing, or of ceremony—as far
as I recollect, some Prince, or great man, or foreign
minister, was taking his departure from the port—and
as we approached Spithead, where a number of
enormous castle-like vessels were lying, the thunder
of cannon from the forts seemed to make the very
irresponsive sea echo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We landed as speedily as possible; and I cannot
say that the aspect of humanity did not somewhat
detract from the impression of the approach. We
were surrounded by a number of greedy and clamorous
people, each of whom seemed to have some peculiar
object to serve, and escaped from them with
difficulty, into a lumbering, dirty, and foul-smelling
vehicle, with a broken window, and straw under our
feet. We had obtained the name of a good inn, however,
and thither we ordered the coachman to drive.
The appearance of the place, as we passed through
the streets, was somewhat like that of the lower part
of Boston; but when we reached the hotel, the aspect
of all things was very different, and I must confess
much more agreeable. There was a neatness, a
comfortableness, an attention without servility which
was very pleasant. Two rooms were shown to
Father Bonneville and myself as our sleeping rooms,
where every thing was clean, precise, and regular,
giving one for the first time a complete notion of
what is meant by the term snug. In each there was
firing ready laid and only waiting to be lighted, and
in the sitting-room, which was large and handsome,
and connected with one of the bed-rooms, the grate
was already blazing with a bright coal fire. We
were scarcely installed when a waiter, with an
apron as white as snow, and a linen jacket without
a spot upon it, came in with a long paper in his
hand, which he called a bill of fare, and asked us to
choose what we would have for dinner. As Father
Bonneville’s stomach was still somewhat under the
influence of the sea, I selected what I thought would
suit him best, and with a rapidity, truly marvellous,
the table was laid with a bright clean damask cloth,
and abundance of silver and glass, the fire was
poked, bread, and supernumerary plates and dishes
set upon a sideboard, and in three minutes after,
two waiters appeared, bringing in various articles of
food, while a somewhat stately personage at their
head, dressed in black coat and black silk stockings,
carried a silver covered dish, which he placed at the
top of the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had chosen plainly enough, and the cookery was
plain also; but the very look of the viands, their
tenderness, their excellence, might have provoked
gluttony in an anchorite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even good Father Bonneville recovered his appetite,
and a glass of wine, though savoring too much
of brandy, for either his palate or my own, aided in
raising his spirits which had been somewhat depressed
before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaning his head gently on one side after the cloth
was cleared away and the waiters had disappeared,
with fine, clear, tall lights upon the table, the curtains
closely drawn, and the fire crackling and sparkling,
and making strange faces for us in the grate, he
began to talk to me about England, in a sort of dreamy
memory-like manner, which made me for a moment
fear that the good old man’s brain had suffered from
grief, and sickness, and time, and that he was slightly
wandering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be fifty years, Louis,” he said, “on the
twentieth of this month, since I was last in this land
of England. It was a very different land then—or I
have much forgotten it. True, I saw not much of
the country; for my life was in the capital—a great
gloomy city, as it seemed to me, with grand and
splendid things going on in it, but which—being excluded
from most of them by profession—seemed
like pictures in what they call a phantasmagoria,
where suddenly out of grim darkness, richly robed
figures rush upon you, and are lost again in a moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never knew you had been in England, my
dear friend,” I replied. “You never told me so, I
think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said thoughtfully, “no. But I was in
London for nearly eighteen months: the chaplain to
the Embassy. Your father was a boy then, Louis,
and I taught him as I have taught you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was coming upon a subject which I had often
wished to broach, but which he had never even approached
before. I know not what were the feelings
which had prevented me from asking questions.
Perhaps they were mingled. We recollect such
sensations more indistinctly than facts that strike the
eye and ear, and fix themselves upon memory by
many holds. Certain I am, however, that it was
not want of curiosity or interest, especially during
our residence in Germany and Switzerland, where I
began to think of every thing, and of my own fate and
situation more than any thing else. As far as I can
recollect, Father Bonneville’s careful avoidance of
the subject, and a sort of dark awe I felt at removing
the veil from what was evidently a mystery, a sort
of impression that there was something dreadful and
horrible behind, often sealed my lips at the moment
I was about to speak. Now, however, I had tasted
enough of sorrow in the world to have manly resolution,
and though Father Bonneville’s weak state of
health had prevented me from inquiring since we had
again met, I asked, at once,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who was my father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laid his hand gently upon mine, as I sat beside
him, near the table, and looked in my face with an
expression not to be forgotten—so mild—so tender—so
sorrowful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ask me no questions, Louis,” he said. “Ask
me no questions just now. You will hear soon
enough; and until I know why the remittances which
were always made me for your support and education
were withheld when I was in America, I
am bound not to speak. If what I fear, is the case,
my lips will be unsealed. If not, you must wait
patiently yet awhile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked down gloomily on the ground for a moment,
and then asked in a cold, somewhat bitter
tone,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me at least, good Father, is there any thing
disgraceful in my birth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, nothing,” he exclaimed, clasping his
hands vehemently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then was my father a villain, a knave, or a
coward?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I loved him well,” replied Father Bonneville, in
a tone of deep emotion, “and so help me heaven, as
I believe there never did exist upon this earth a
more gallant gentleman, a more honorable and upright
man, or a more sincere Christian than your
father. He was only too good for his age and for
his country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A deep silence succeeded, which continued for
several minutes, and then, with a sort of gentle art, he
turned the conversation to my residence in Germany,
and my poor Louise—for by this time I had told him
all—and strove to win me from a subject which he
saw agitated me so much, by leading me to one of
milder sorrow. But my heart was too full to bear
it; my replies were as brief as reverence for him
would permit, and thus ended our first day in England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a luxurious dressing-room in one of the most
aristocratic mansions of Montreal, a young girl stood
before a cheval-glass which gave back the full-length
reflection of her lovely person, from the rich luxuriance
of her rose-crowned ringlets to the sole of the
fairy foot, now clad in a sylvan buskin, laced with
silken strings over the delicate and naked ankle.
The girl’s dress was a fanciful one—it had just been
sent home from the dress-maker’s, and she was but
rehearsing in it, preparatory to her appearance as the
goddess Flora at a fancy-ball, to be given shortly by
the officers of the garrison to the <span class='it'>élite</span> of the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An attempt to personate the bright floral divinity
of Spring might seem to argue undue vanity on the
part of Alicia de Rochemont, but she had consented
to do so at the suggestion of her preferred admirer,
Captain Clairville, who declared that he had once
met the celebrated Dutchess of S—— in that character,
at a masquerade, and that she looked divinely, though
even her fresh and radiant beauty was far less dazzling
than that of Miss De Rochemont’s. Alicia
thought every one who flattered her sincere, and so
she believed the gay captain, and following his directions
as to her costume, stood now before her
mirror, a lovely impersonation of the ever-youthful
deity who presides over the floral creation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her robe, of the finest tissue, changed its hues
with every motion of the graceful wearer, now glowing
with tints of sapphire, now assuming the hue of
the rose, then fading to a tender purple, or a violet-azure,
and the effect of all was softened by the transparent
folds of an almost impalpable veil, which
floated around the figure of the goddess, like the
fleecy clouds which in the balmy nights of summer
follow the bright pathway of the moon, chastening
often, but never obscuring her lustre. Her white
and rounded arms, bare to the shoulders, were
wreathed with flowers; her hair was crowned with
roses, and in one hand she carried a cornucopia
filled with exquisite blossoms, which she was supposed
to scatter on the earth, as she passed over it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a few minutes Alicia continued to survey herself
with evident satisfaction—turning first to this
side, then to that, and at last retreating step by step,
and again slowly advancing toward her mirror, to
study the full effect of her brilliant <span class='it'>tout ensemble</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Wetmore says, Miss,” remarked her maid,
“that there will not be so beautiful a dress among
them all as yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor so handsome a goddess,” responded Alicia,
“did she not say that also, Ferris?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course she did, Miss,” returned the maid,
who always stood ready to apply the unction of flattery
to her young mistress—“everybody says that,”
she added, “and sure if they did not, your own mirror
would tell it to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But everybody might not believe what the mirror
says, Ferris, though neither you nor I think it tells
lies,” said Alicia. “But never mind, it is all very
well, except these mock-roses, and they are such
trumpery things I will not disgrace myself by wearing
them,” and snatching the garland of artificial
roses from her head she threw it contemptuously
across the floor. “I can have abundance of natural
flowers of every description except roses, and every
one tells me they are not to be found.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, Miss, how can you expect to have them?
Sure, they will not blow in the midst of these mountains
of snow,” said Ferris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Captain Clairville declares I am no true
goddess without them,” said Alicia—“that the
Dutchess of S—— had the loveliest crown of fragrant
roses on her head, besides boquets of them in her
hands and on her bosom, and that to be seen with
these things of cloth and wire would make me ridiculous.
No, it will never do; I must and will have
real roses—roses! roses! Ferris, for the Goddess
Flora, or I will go to bed and not get up again for a
year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh pray, Miss, don’t talk so,” said Ferris. “I
am sure I would get roses for you if I could—but
where upon earth are they to be had in the heart of
this terrible winter? All the gardeners say theirs
have frozen, and for that matter, Miss, I was near
being frozen myself the bitter day you sent me out
to ransack the suburbs for them—into every alley
and corner I went without finding so much as a bud
to bless myself with, though Dame Paton says hers
never failed before, and in the coldest weather the
Misses Franchettes were never known to be without
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you said something, Ferris, of a rose-tree
which a poor girl had in some out of the way place,
I forget where. Pray why cannot you get from
them the flowers I want, and which indeed I must
and will have?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, la! Miss, who would have the heart to rob
that bush? It blossoms but once a year, and is the
only treasure of a poor girl who watches its flowers
to lay them on her mother’s grave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How doleful! Is it a sad-looking rose, Ferris?”
asked Alicia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no, Miss, quite gay, and the loveliest white,
with just the faintest blush you ever saw,” said
Ferris—“at least, so the buds looked which were
just bursting open—perfect wreaths of them, which
would bring ever so much money if the girl would
only sell them; but no, she will not part with one,
saving them all till the anniversary of her mother’s
death, when she strews them over her grave, and
they say it is a lovely sight to see the heap of snow
which covers it all of a blush with the living
roses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How strange! quite sentimental, I declare,”
said Alicia, adjusting her veil into more becoming
folds before the mirror as she spoke. “But, then,”
she added, “what a sin to throw away such lovely
flowers; just now, too, when there is nowhere else a
rose to be had, and so many would be thankful for
them at any price. I am sure they would adorn the
living more than the dead, for exposed to this frightful
cold they cannot even beautify the grave many
minutes before they are changed to ice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Miss, old Suzanne says she has seen them
lying there for days together; stiff enough to be sure,
but looking blooming, and so beautiful in the white
snow, and sometimes there falls a fine sleet and
freezes on them, and they sparkle as if covered with
diamonds; and then Rosalie, that is the name of the
young girl, smiles and says the angels have wept on
them—so she watches them till they change, and
then throws over them the lightest snow she can
find, and they settle down as the snow melts, and in
the spring their faded leaves are all found lying on
the green grave, sometimes quite fresh-like and sweet
as it were.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a fuss about nothing,” said the volatile
beauty; “the girl must have lost her senses, or if
she has not, other people have, to see such lovely
roses perishing in the snow, and never taking the
trouble to carry them away from that frozen place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, Miss, lift them from the grave!” exclaimed
Ferris, with a burst of indignation that reproved
the flippant selfishness of her mistress, “who
would dare do such a thing? It would be the very
sin of sacrilege that Father Dougherty talked of last
Sunday, and I for one, would choose never to look
upon another flower, rather than pluck even a leaf
from those which that poor girl lays upon her mother’s
grave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goodness me, Ferris, how very pathetic you
are,” said Alicia, slightly coloring, with shame we
hope, “but I am not so easily melted, and the roses I
<span class='it'>must</span> have—fairly purchased of the girl if she will
sell them, if not, by some other means, for obtain
them I must; and if with your aid, Ferris, a rich
reward shall be yours—if you refuse it, there are
those to whom I have shown far less kindness than
to you who would not so willingly disoblige me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, Miss,” said Ferris, half-crying and
alarmed by the dread of losing a good place, “there
is nobody in the whole world that I would do so
much for as you—any thing that was right, Miss, I
could never disobey you in—but to rob the dead!
who could do that and hope ever to have a quiet
night again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense!” ejaculated Alicia, with a contemptuous
curl of her pretty lip, “what have you to do
with the dead in this matter? I ask you to go to the
living, to the girl herself once more, and tempt her
with gold, which she must need, to give you these
precious flowers. I do not care what you offer her,
sovereigns, guineas, any thing you please, if so you
win from her the roses—I am no goddess without
them—but crowned with such a lovely garland, I
shall rival Flora herself—walk a divinity among the
men, and cause all the women to expire with
envy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at the bare thought of such a triumph, the
spoiled little beauty crossed the room with as regal
a step as though she really trod the cloudy heights
of Olympus, and casting off her veil and robe of
changeful hue, she wrapped her fairy form in a luxurious
dressing-gown, and sunk quite exhausted into
the arms of a capacious <span class='it'>fauteuil</span>, from beneath the
downy cushions of which she drew forth the last
new novel, and soon seemingly abandoned herself to
its absorbing interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will try, Miss, once more for the roses,” said
Ferris, as she turned to leave the room, “unless you
are willing Grayson should go—she knows the
place, for she went there with me, Miss, and would,
I think, be much more likely to get them than I
should.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I care not a pin who goes, Ferris,” said Alicia,
looking up from beneath the mass of silk and down
in which she sat half-buried—“only let me have the
roses and I will not even ask how they were got, or
by whom.” And again she sunk listlessly down
into what might have seemed a little bundle of embroidered
silk, but for the crown of shining ringlets
just visible in its midst.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The scene of our tale changes from the abode of
wealth and fashion to the humble dwelling of poverty,
with its trials and privations—from the exhibition
of a spoiled and petted beauty’s vain and idle
caprices, to the manifestations of a pure and noble
spirit, oppressed by misfortune, yet true to its own
high convictions of duty, gently submissive to the
Divine hand which guided and sustained it, and ever
shedding around its lowly sphere the light and peace
of its own heavenly faith and love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a narrow cross-street of one of the most obscure
suburbs of the city, stood a dilapidated house, the
small attic of which was tenanted by an elderly man
and his daughter, the former of whom was now lying
motionless upon his bed, either insensible or asleep;
and to judge from his wasted and ghastly appearance,
approaching near the confines of that world
where the weary spirit finds release and rest. Beside
him, at a small table, sat a young girl of singularly
sweet and interesting appearance, without
what a common observer would designate beauty,
and yet with “something than beauty dearer,” irradiating
her calm, pure face; a soul-light from within,
shining and giving to it that heavenly expression
which reminded one of the angelic faces which beam
from the breathing canvas of Raphael. Her soft,
brown hair fell back in wavy curls from her smooth
brow, and in her dark hazel-eyes, with their long-fringed
drooping lids, there was a depth of unrevealed
and gentle sensibilities, and a lurking tenderness
around her mouth, which indicated timidity and
sweetness—some might have thought it weakness,
had not the slight and graceful curve of the upper
lip rescued it from that suspicion—denoting a firm,
if a gentle soul, and a courage strong to dare
and endure in the path of woman’s duty, thorny and
rugged though that path might chance to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the small table before her lay a cluster of snow-white
camelias, with a few other flowers of equal
beauty. Whence, at so inclement a season, came
those frail and delicate blossoms into that bare and
lonely attic? A nearer glance informed the gazer
that those lovely imitations of Nature’s fairest forms
were of wax, moulded by the skill and taste of the
young artist into such perfection as to deceive the
most practiced eye. Thrown by a series of afflictive
dispensations wholly upon her own resources
for the support of her sick father and herself, Rosalie
La Motte had exercised in turn her various accomplishments
to avert the want and destitution which
menaced her—but notwithstanding the elegance of
the various articles which she produced, she found
it difficult to obtain purchasers for them, though she
did not hesitate to seek a sale for them at the shops,
and even to offer them at the doors of some of the
finest houses of the city. They were generally
turned over with indifference and dismissed, or purchased
at half their value, by those who thought more
of making a good bargain than of aiding the pale and
delicate girl who was so nobly struggling against
poverty and misfortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the disposal of her wax-flowers Rosalie had
met with better success—they were too exquisite
not to win admiration, and several had purchased
single flowers or small bouquets without disputing the
price, and so encouraged, when she could procure
the materials, she continued, upon a small scale, her
tasteful manufacture, and thus, for the present, was
enabled to provide comforts for her father, and defray
the trifling expenses of her humble home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus to struggle on alone and unfriended, was
indeed heroic in one born to better fortunes, and nurtured
in a home of ease and indulgence, as was the
young and gentle Rosalie. Early in life her father
had emigrated from Lyons to New Orleans, where
he established a mercantile house, which soon became
one of the richest in the city. He married a
lovely woman, and children gathered around him.
But then troubles came, as they come to all—for they
are part of life’s discipline, aiding us to solve its deep
mysteries, and unveiling our spiritual sight to behold
the glories of that higher life toward which the good
and true are constantly ascending. An infant son
died, and then a darling daughter, just budding into her
tenth sweet summer. The mother was grief-stricken—the
father’s energies paralyzed, and during this
season of heavy trial, an ambitious and unprincipled
partner of the house availed himself of the opportunity
to embark in a daring and uncertain speculation,
which failed, as might have been expected, involving
the whole concern in irretrievable ruin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same messenger who brought these evil
tidings to the unhappy merchant, then residing at his
country seat, brought also letters from an uncle of
Mr. La Motte’s on the mother’s side, who had been
for many years a resident in Canada, engaged there
in the lucrative North West trade. The communication
from Mr. McMillan stated that he had now
retired from active business, and having no home of
his own, he wished his nephew to remove with his
family to Montreal, that he might find one with those
whom he intended as the heirs of his fortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruined in fortune, and broken down in spirit, Mr.
La Motte resolved to accept his uncle’s cordial invitation,
and accordingly wrote him to that effect,
but unfortunately the letter never reached its destination.
Again Mr. McMillan wrote, but by some
untoward accident his letter went astray—and a
rumor which soon after prevailed, owing to Mr.
La Motte’s remaining in retirement, that he had returned
with his family to France, reached the ears
of his uncle, and prevented his writing again. In
the meantime, the cholera broke out in the devoted
city of Montreal, and Mr. McMillan was among its
first victims. His life had not been such as to enable
him to meet death in peace, and in the vain
hope that he should thus make some atonement for
his sins, he gave the whole of his property to the
church, and died in the belief that its purchased
masses would insure the safety of his soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Delayed by illness and other unforeseen causes, it
was not till the autumn of that fatal year, that Mr.
La Motte, with his wife and daughter, arrived in
Montreal, only to meet new trial and disappointment,
for the first answers to inquiries respecting his
relative, informed him of his death, and the disposition
of his entire property to the church. Thus
left friendless, almost penniless, in a strange land,
with a wife and child, bred in affluence, dependent
upon him, the unfortunate La Motte was ready to
sink beneath the heavy burden of his lot. But something
must be done, so a small house was rented, and
through the friendly services of a distant relative of
his late uncle, Mr. La Motte obtained the situation
of under-clerk, with a very moderate remuneration,
in a mercantile house in the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a new position for one who had been for
many prosperous years at the head of an extensive
establishment of his own; but it averted immediate
want, and enabled him to provide a shelter for those
dear ones who leaned upon him—a humble one it is
true, compared to the comfort and luxurious beauty
of their southern home; but it was their own—and
beautified by the wife’s patient sweetness, the
daughter’s loving smiles and tender assiduities for
the happiness of her parents, it became a haven of
peace to the worn and weary man. So passed away
the first year of their northern sojourn; but with the
falling of the next autumn leaves, a gathering cloud
threatened to overshadow their calm sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The change of climate and of circumstances had
seriously affected Mrs. La Motte’s health—her step
became feeble—a cough convulsed her slight frame,
and the beautiful but fearful hectic of consumption
lent its fatal lustre to her cheek and eye. She faded
fast, and with the early snows of winter the broken-hearted
husband and weeping daughter, saw her dear
and cherished form borne forever from the humble
home, which her presence had sanctified and blessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not mourn thus bitterly, my Rosalie,” she
said, on the day of her departure. “I am not leaving
you, my child, but only passing from your outward
sight, to be still nearer to you in thought and
affection. This life, dearest, we have found one of
trial and change—but we both believe that the one
toward which I am rapidly advancing, upon which
I shall soon enter, is one of beauty and of peace—of
joy unspeakable and of endless development.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear mamma, I know this,” said the weeping
girl; “and for you I do rejoice—but oh, this
seeming separation—how sad it is!” and a fresh
burst of sorrow impeded her utterance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ever think of it <span class='it'>but</span> as a <span class='it'>seeming</span> separation, for
it is one only to the eye of sense,” said Mrs. La
Motte. “That which we call death, dear Rosalie,
is but a change in the mode of our existence—a continuation
of life, higher, fuller, more free than that
which we know here, in a world of light and beauty
far more real than this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes, dear mamma,” said Rosalie, “I dread
death only because it severs the close-knit ties of
earth—thanks to your teachings, I have always regarded
it as a beautiful and benignant ministration
of our Heavenly Father’s love—as the birth-day of
the soul to a higher and happier life, without satiety
or end. But this day, mamma, brings to me a double
bereavement, for it is that on which our sweet Adalia
left us—and now—and now—” She paused, covering
her streaming eyes with her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and she is near me—very near—waiting to
conduct me to her spirit-home,” said the mother, with
a rapt look, as though she indeed gazed upon the
form of her departed child—as who shall say she did
not, or that our loved ones do not ever sit beside our
dying pillow, as is the sweet belief, and a true one,
as we think, of many.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The dear rose-tree she planted,” resumed the
dying mother, after a moment’s pause, “will soon be
bright with blossoms, as on the day she left us—let
its flowers, my Rosalie, cover my snowy grave, and
on each anniversary of my departure, strew them
there in remembrance of us both.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—yes, dear mamma!” was all the sobbing
girl could utter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do so, darling child,” said the mother—“our
spirits will be with you, my Rosalie—and never,
never, dear one, forget while it lives, to cherish for
her sweet sake, the rose-tree her young hand
planted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never! my own mamma,” sobbed Rosalie;
“for her dear sake and yours, it shall be a sacred
thing to me always.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was on the first day of her illness that the little
Adalia had planted this rose-tree, then a tiny thing;
and before another spring came round, its flowers
were strewn upon her grave. From that time the
plant was watched with reverent care by the tender
mother; and when she left her southern home for
the colder north, this cherished thing accompanied
her, though there were many others far more useful
and costly that were necessarily left behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The death of his wife gave the final blow to Mr.
La Motte’s health and spirits—still he struggled on,
but evidently with a broken-heart, till finally a sudden
paralysis, which partially affected the mind, and
wholly prostrated the physical powers, laid him
helpless upon a weary bed of pain. It was then,
when every earthly stay seemed to have deserted
her, that all the hidden strength and beauty of Rosalie’s
character were developed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deprived at once of the power of active exertion,
Mr. La Motte’s small income ceased—the house they
occupied, humble as it was, could no longer be retained—and
Rosalie, all inexperienced, felt the necessity
of looking out for a less expensive abode. After long
and patient search she at length discovered the old
house with its unoccupied attic, where we have introduced
her to the reader, and to which she removed
her father, with the few articles of comfort and convenience
she could afford to keep, and there for many
months she had now toiled unremittingly for their
support.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But amid all the toils and privations of her lot, her
cheerfulness and serene temper remained unclouded—her
patience unshaken—her trust and faith in her
heavenly Father’s love and goodness, calm and unfaltering.
Nor, helpless and often querulous through
weariness and suffering as her father was, did she
ever fail toward him in her task of duty, or in the
constancy of her affection. He only, of the dear
household band, remained to her; and the devotion
she felt for him absorbed the whole of her being,
except that higher sentiment which belonged to
Him who had breathed into her an immortal spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her own frail and delicate appearance told, however,
that the soul’s struggle for resignation and
cheerfulness, though successful, had too terribly
shaken the physical frame, ever to permit the flush
of health and joy to invigorate it again. Short and
quick, after every exertion, came the labored breath,
and the slightest fatigue or emotion dyed the fair
cheek with that brilliant hue, which they who know
its fatal warning, tremble to behold.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The small apartment occupied by Rosalie and her
father, though scrupulously neat and clean, was
almost bare of furniture. A few necessary and very
simple articles it contained, and nothing else, beside
the lovely wax flowers upon the table, worthy of
observation, except the tall and thriving rose-tree,
whose bursting buds, fast unfolding into full-blown
flowers, were consecrated to the memory of the
departed. It was growing in the graceful Wedgwood
vase in which the little Adalia had planted it,
and before the recess of the window where it stood
hung a curtain so thin as not to exclude the air,
while it answered the design for which it was intended,
to screen it from the curious eye of casual
visitors. This curtain was now drawn aside, revealing
the graceful plant in its flush of beauty, and as
Rosalie sat moulding the plastic wax into exquisite
floral forms with her delicate fingers, she often turned
her eyes from the still and deathlike features of her
father to its green branches, drooping with the weight
of their clustered buds, and a sad and tender smile
would linger on her lips, and a dewy lustre moisten
her soft, hazel eye as she gazed—while at times
some secret thought framed itself into words, and
fell in broken murmurs from her tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last she rose, and advancing to the tree, lifted
a trailing branch, and wound it round a stronger one
for support, tears like dew-drops falling upon its
bright buds as she said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear mamma, the rose-tree our Adalia
planted, and which you loved, is blooming for you,
and once again your daughter’s hand will strew its
leaves over your snowy bed. Once more! but another
year—and who will shed them there? Ah!
it matters not—we shall ere then be reunited where
brighter flowers than those of earth will bloom for
us eternally.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A radiant smile lighted up her sweet face as she
uttered these words, and her delicate cheek flushed
with the lovely but fatal hectic which lurked in her
system, and set the seal of truth upon her prophecy.
As she turned slowly from the window she saw her
father move—he had awakened, and she hastened
toward the bed. The sick man looked upon his
child with a vacant eye, as she tenderly bent over
him. She saw that his lips were parched, and pouring
some liquid into a cup, she held it to him, and
he drank eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you slept well, dear papa?” she gently
asked, as she tenderly arranged his pillow, and
smoothed the thin hair from his furrowed brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned his dreamy eye toward her, and it
brightened up with loving recollections, as he scanned
in silence the features so dear, and so familiar
to his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Slept!” he said at last, in a low and feeble voice.
“I have been sailing, Rosalie, on a broad, bright
river, and angels guided my vessel. Adalia was in
my arms, and she, your angel mother, sat beside me,
with her patient smile, and her sunny eye that, with
its look of love, ever chased the shadows from my
heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear papa, you weary yourself,” said the anxious
girl, as he paused, laboring for breath. “Rest awhile,
for I know it all—mamma was with you, and you
were happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he answered with animation, “I was
happy. I felt her hand in mine, and we sailed onward
and onward, far away from all sights and
sounds of earth, into a glorious atmosphere, golden
with the light of heaven—and all around us was <span class='it'>His</span>
near presence, wrapping our souls in a garment of
blessedness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is always round us, dear papa,” said Rosalie,
alarmed at his increasing excitement; “always—even
here in this poor room, where we seem left to
drink the cup of poverty alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A dream!—but was it <span class='it'>only</span> a <span class='it'>dream</span> then, Rosalie?”
murmured the sick man with a troubled
look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, dear papa; but a visitation of angels to cheer
your slumbers, and whisper to your spirit of the peace
and bliss of heaven,” said the gentle daughter, imprinting
a kiss of love upon his cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes; and to tell me of her guardian care,”
he said; then in a clear voice, and with a burst of

<p class='noindent'>And so soothed by the cheering vision, the invalid
sank again into a deep and peaceful slumber, which
was again brightened, as the sleep of the departing
often is, by glimpses of that fair spirit-land in which
the sufferer is so soon to awaken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosalie had just finished adjusting the bed-clothes
around her father, when steps and voices were heard
ascending the stairs. She glanced at the precious
rose-tree, and with eager hand hastened to draw the
curtain before the little recess where it stood, which
she had scarcely time to do, before the door was
suddenly opened, without even the ceremony of a
rap, and a matronly lady, dressed in rich and fashionable
costume, and attended by a female servant,
entered the apartment. Rosalie instantly divined
the cause of their appearance in her humble abode,
for in the person of the latter she recognized one of
the women who, a few days previous, had come
there with a desire to purchase the cherished roses,
whose bloom she watched with interest and solicitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an instant she stood silent and embarrassed
before the intruders, then recovering herself, with
that graceful courtesy which ever distinguishes the
well-bred and refined, she drew forward a chair and
invited the lady to sit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a slight and condescending nod, Madame de
Rochemont, for it was the mother of Alicia, took
possession of the offered seat, at the same time casting
a glance of eager inquiry around the apartment.
As she did so, her eye was attracted by the lovely
wax flowers which lay upon the table, and bending
toward them,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless me!” she exclaimed, “what exquisite
flowers!” then, as a nearer view revealed to her
their true quality, she added—“and of wax too, I
declare! Are they for sale—and do you make them?”
she asked, looking at Rosalie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I make them, Madame, but these are already disposed
of,” replied Rosalie. “I shall gladly, however,
make others if they are wished for, and as many as
may be ordered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it is your business, is it,” said the lady superciliously;
“and pray, what may be your charge
for a bunch like this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only a pound, Madame,” answered Rosalie,
quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Only</span> a pound!” repeated Madame de Rochemont,
with a sneering emphasis on the “<span class='it'>only</span>.”
“Very moderate, truly! and here are two camelias
with a bud, a Provence rose, and a sprig of myrtle—why
you must be making your fortune at this rate,
child!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Considering the labor and expense attending the
preparation of the material, for I color and mould the
wax myself, the profit is very trifling,” said Rosalie.
“Besides,” she added, “I have received few orders
for the flowers, as I am almost a stranger in the city,
and have commenced making them for sale only
since my father’s illness.” Her voice slightly trembled
as she made this allusion, but her emotion passed
unheeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were your prices more moderate you would
have more orders than you could execute,” said
Madame de Rochemont. “For instance, if you
consent to charge but ten shillings, instead of twenty,
for a bouquet like this, which is enough in all conscience,
I will take one myself, and procure you at
least a dozen purchasers among my own private
friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is impossible, Madame, for me to make them
at so low a price,” said Rosalie; “it would not repay
me for the cost of the materials—these should bring
me one pound ten, in justice to myself, but necessity
compels me to part with them just now at a
lower rate than I can afford; but I am to take
them to the lady who ordered them at three
o’clock, and I shall decline making any more at
that price.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, child, you cannot expect patronage, if you
persist in such extravagant terms,” said the lady,
turning with an air of indifference from the wax camelias,
and adding, as she again sent her searching
gaze round the room—“but it was not to purchase
artificial flowers that I came here this morning. My
daughter’s maid, and my own, whom (with a glance
at Grayson) perhaps you may recognize, in their
search after flowers for the fancy ball, found their
way here a day or two since, and brought back to
us a story of the beautiful rose-tree you have somewhere
here, and of your refusal, owing to some sort
of a whim, to part with any of the flowers, though,
from appearances, one would think you might have
been willing to exchange what must be useless to
you, for a much less sum than she was bidden to
offer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The roses she wished to purchase, Madame,”
said Rosalie, with emotion, “have a value to me,
that, with all my pressing wants, gold fails to possess.
They are,” she added, tears filling her soft
eyes, “memorials of a beloved mother and sister—the
tree was planted by the latter, and for her sake
fondly cherished, amid the wreck of almost all else
that we possessed—its first flowers were laid upon her
grave, and now, yearly, I watch its bloom to strew
them on my mother’s—nor can I let even my poverty
tempt me to neglect this duty, which, on each anniversary
of her death, I promised her faithfully to
perform.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A covert sneer lurked round the mouth of Madame
de Rochemont, who wanted sensibility to appreciate
a sentiment so tender and refined; but there was a
gentle dignity, a touching truthfulness in Rosalie’s
words and manner, that checked the sarcasm which
else she might have uttered, and with an air of cold
nonchalance, she only said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, I see—a little bit of romance—but never
mind. If not too precious to be seen, will you favor
me with a sight of this wonderful rose-tree?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus requested, Rosalie advanced to the window,
and drawing aside the thin curtain which screened
it from observation, displayed the lovely bush with
its rich wreaths of spotless buds, now rapidly unfolding
in the light and warmth of a bright January
sun, which streamed from the brilliant azure of a
Canadian sky full upon it. Madame de Rochemont
gave audible expression to her admiration at sight
of the beautiful plant, and renewed her request, at
any price, to obtain its blossoms. But Rosalie, true
to her filial idea of love and duty, would not be
tempted to depart from it, even by the sight of the
offered gold, one piece of which would have lightened
the incessant toil to which she was now subjected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The continued sound of voices in the apartment
at length aroused the sick man from his slumbers;
and with that confused feeling which, even in health,
often accompanies the first moments of awaking
from a sound sleep, he looked up around, unable
to conjecture where he was, or from whom or
whence the unusual hum of voices proceeded. At
length, his ear traced them to the window, and listening
more intently, he caught some words respecting
the rose-tree—a thing not less sacred to him than to
his daughter—which startled and interested him.
With a preternatural strength he raised himself upon
his elbow, and gazed at the speakers, striving to take
into his confused mind the meaning of the scene before
him, when he saw the woman Grayson, while
her mistress held Rosalie’s attention engaged, glide
quietly to the opposite side of the tree, and screened
from their notice by its thick foliage, grasp a branch
with one hand, while in the other she held a glittering
pair of scissors, with which she was in the act
of severing it from the main stalk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Electrified by the sight, an unwonted energy
nerved him, and he sent forth a loud, unearthly cry,
a sudden out-burst of mingled agony and fear, which
chilled the blood of those who heard it:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The roses, the roses! Child, child, be not faithless
to your mother’s wish!” he gasped, in thrilling
accents, and then sunk back exhausted on his pillow.
The scissors fell from the hand of Grayson in her
momentary fright, and she dropped the branch she
had only partially severed; but hardened and fearless,
she would almost instantly have returned to
complete her purpose, had not Madame de Rochemont,
with a look of mingled terror and annoyance,
beckoned her away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us be gone from this place,” she said; “all
the roses in the world are not worth the shock my
nerves have received from the shriek of that madman
yonder. Let the girl keep her flowers, if she
prizes them above bread, and reap the fruits of her
folly, as she will doubtless do soon. Come, Grayson—I
am in haste; for I cannot breathe in this horrid
attic another moment;” and sweeping past the bed
without turning a glance of pity or inquiry toward
the apparently dying man, over whom the poor
daughter was bending in love and terror, she disappeared
through the door, followed by her reluctant
waiting-woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grayson, however—as determined a she-wolf as
ever thirsted for the blood of an innocent lamb—had
by no means relinquished her purpose. She was to
receive a rich bribe from Alicia if she succeeded in
it, and she was resolved not to give it up. Ferris
was too conscientious and too tender-hearted to do
any thing further in the matter, and she would have
lost her place for declining, had not her services been
too valuable to her selfish young mistress to be lightly
dispensed with. But Grayson was troubled with no
such scruples of conscience, and the moment she saw
her mistress seated in her carriage, which waited at
the end of the little street, and had received her dismission,
she returned to a small Canadian house
which stood just opposite the one she had recently
quitted, the occupants of which, an old man and
woman, were known to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the pretence of paying them a friendly visit,
she sat down at the window to watch for Rosalie,
who, she remembered to have said, that at three
o’clock she was to take home the wax flowers she
had made. She waited patiently till the hour arrived—but
then, when minute after minute passed on, till
a quarter sounded from the old clock of the French
Seminary, she began to fear that the sick man was
either dead, or so much worse as to prevent his
daughter from leaving him. However, just as she
was hesitating what course to pursue, the door of the
opposite house was opened, and Rosalie appeared,
with the gray capote of her little Canadian cloak
drawn closely over her head—for it was snowing
fast—and carrying a small basket in her hand. She
tripped quickly down the narrow street, and when
Grayson saw her turn the corner, she rose and said
she must be going, but that she would first just step
over the way and see how the sick man was, to
whom her mistress sometimes sent jelly. The old
woman nodded her approbation of the neighborly
act, and Grayson departed on her wicked errand.
She found the street-door opposite open, and softly
ascending the stairs, she reached the attic without
encountering any one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosalie had left the door of her room slightly a-jar
when she went out, as was her custom, that the
woman who occupied the apartment below—a decent
and quiet person—might hear her father’s bell, should
he touch the small one beside him. She had left
him in a tranquil sleep, and apparently recovered from
the preceding excitement, and expecting to be absent
a very short time, she felt no more anxiety than
usual respecting him, nor hesitated to leave him
alone as she was in the habit of doing when obliged
to go out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grayson softly entered the room, and with the
stealthy step of a cat glided swiftly across it, casting
a furtive glance at the sleeper as she passed the bed
to assure herself that all was safe—then flinging aside
the curtain which concealed the rose-tree, she drew
forth her sharp, bright scissors, and commenced the
work of destruction. Wreaths and clusters of those
bursting buds and full-blown roses she relentlessly
severed from the parent tree, depositing them
in a capacious handkerchief which she had spread
upon the floor to receive them, till the beautiful plant—but
just now crowned with living bloom and
beauty—stood before her shorn and disfigured by her
cruel theft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In haste to be gone, she cast the last roses on her
heap of spoils, and was carefully drawing the corners
of the handkerchief together that she might not crush
them, when a low sort of hissing sound from the bed
startled her. She looked up, and at the sight which
met her view, even her bold heart quailed with momentary
fear and awe. Sitting upright, she beheld
Mr. La Motte, his tall, erect form emaciated almost
to a skeleton, one hand feebly grasping the pillow
for support, the other, thin and shadowy, stretched
with a menacing gesture toward her. His ghostly
face, rendered still more so by the black hair,
streaked with gray, which had grown long during
his illness, and which hung round it, giving it the
livid hue of death; but intense life seemed centered
in his eyes, which—dark as night, deep sunk and
large—glared upon her with a look of terrible rage
and ferocity, while his skinny lips, drawn apart in a
vain effort to give utterance to his wrath, disclosed
two rows of teeth glittering with deathly whiteness,
that lent a supernatural aspect to the countenance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quickly gathering up the stolen roses, Grayson
darted toward the door; but when the sick man saw
her actually escaping with the treasured flowers, his
agony burst forth in burning words:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fiend! fiend!” he shouted; “you have robbed
the dead! they are here—they call you to give back—give
back—the—” and his speech failing by degrees,
and his unnatural strength yielding before the
violence of the effort he made, he fell over insensible
on the edge of the bed, upsetting the little table, and
causing the hand-bell—placed on it for his use—to
roll on the floor, ringing out its loudest peal as it
fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without a moment’s pause, Grayson rushed down
the two pair of shaking stairs to the lower lobby.
She found the street-door closed, and while she was
attempting to open it—which in her haste she did
not quickly accomplish—she heard the woman who
occupied the room below the attic, come out and
ascend the stairs; and a moment after, her voice
sounded from the upper landing, calling to some one
below—“Pray come up, quick! I think the sick
man is dead! Where is the girl? Can no one find
her, to come to her father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grayson waited to hear no more, but hastily quitting
the house, ran as fast as her feet could move
down the little street. Just as she turned the corner,
she encountered Rosalie, who started and turned
pale, and Grayson thought looked suspiciously at
her; but she carried the bundle of roses hidden under
her cloak, and so she passed on unquestioned. Rosalie,
too—though with a heart filled with dark misgivings—went
quickly on her homeward way, to find, alas!
those misgivings more than realized in the new misfortunes
which there awaited her.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>As Rosalie ascended the stairs to the attic, she
heard, through the half-open door of a room which
she passed, the words—“He is dead, and the girl is
away.” Every syllable fell like a bolt of ice upon
her heart, for to whom could they refer except to her
father and herself? She paused not to think or
question; fear, agony—every terrible emotion had
lent wings to her feet, she flew upward like a hunted
bird, one dreadful thought impelling her onward till
she reached the bedside of her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Around it stood two or three females, tenants of
the house, gazing on the rigid, cold form, pale as
marble, which, with closed eyes and motionless
hands lay extended before them. With a cry of anguish
that would have pierced the most stony heart,
Rosalie sprang forward, and laying her now burning
cheek on the cold one of her father’s, and casting
her soft arms around his neck, she called to him in
accents, whose tender pathos none could hear unmoved;
she implored him to speak to his own Rosalie;
to come back from death, and live for her who
had none to live for but him. She mingled passionate
and broken prayers with her adjurations, that God
would restore her dear father again to her; and
while she prayed, warm tears fell like summer rain
upon the pale face against which her sweet one rested,
and like the grateful dews upon the faded herbage,
they did indeed recall the departing from the
gates of death, to the consciousness of his daughter’s
warm embrace and loving kiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt at last the beating of his heart beneath the
pressure of her small hand, his respiration feebly
fanned her cheek, his closed eyelids quivered; and
while her soul bowed down in thankfulness, they
were upraised with a beaming look of love, which
sent its light and joy into her sinking heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Rosalie,” he said, striving to cast his
feeble arms around her; “Still a dweller in the
tearful valley of discipline and trial; but courage,
courage, my own love—the veil of earthly life has been
lifted from before me, and I have gazed into the unseen.”
His voice sunk lower, and he paused. Rosalie
pressed her cheek still closer to his, but sobs
were her only utterance. “Peace, little one,” he
said, with tenderness ineffable. “Peace, for they
are with us! I have seen them, and soon we shall
go home to them. Home! home!” he said exultingly—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

<p class='line0'>“Where happy spirits dwell,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;There, where one loving word</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Alone is never heard,</p>
<p class='line0'>That loving word, <span class='it'>farewell</span>!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Again his eyes closed; and with a smile of serenity
upon his lips he slept, or seemed to sleep, tranquilly
as an infant. Rosalie raised her head and gazed upon
his placid face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The peace which passeth all understanding, the
peace of heaven is within this breast,” she murmured,
laying her head upon his bosom, while the breath
of prayer went up like fragrant incense from her
crushed and bleeding heart. The women had all
withdrawn except one, and she, with pitying and
kindly purpose, remained to comfort the young girl,
and give aid, if need were, to the father; and so in
silence a short interval passed, when again the sick
man moved, and the watchful child raised her head
to catch and interpret his first look; but, as she met
his restless and troubled gaze, she saw that the clear
intellect had become clouded, even before he spoke,
and then, with his first word, her fear became certainty.
Casting an anxious glance toward the window—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has she robbed us of them <span class='it'>all</span>?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What? dear papa,” inquired Rosalie, tenderly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The roses, child; your mother’s roses, and Adalia’s.
They asked me for them just now; their bed,
they said, was cold, and they wanted their life and
bloom to warm the snow which covered it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear papa, I will lay them there to-morrow. It
brings round the day on which they left us,” said
Rosalie, sadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow, yes!” he responded; “but will
there be any to shed them on us when we shall
lie there with them, Rosalie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear papa, we shall be cared for then as now,”
she answered soothingly; “He who brightens our
poor room with those sweet flowers, will then have
received us where brighter ones bloom—never to
decay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes,” murmured the invalid: then with an
agitated look he asked again—“but has she taken
them all? Look, Rosalie—see if there be one bud
left and bring it to me, that I may know if it is like
those I saw on Adalia’s brow, in the spirit-land.
Go, child!” perceiving her still beside him; “Go,
and bring me buds and roses from <span class='it'>her</span> tree—their
fragrance will soothe me like the whisper of her
loving voice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus urged, Rosalie rose to obey him. The fading
light of the short winter day was just deepening
into twilight, but a bright ray from the still illuminated
west shot through the small window and rested
on the poor, shorn rose-tree, crowning it with a rosy
smile, as if to comfort it for the loss of its flowers.
As she approached it, Rosalie was struck with something
strange in its appearance, but the day was
waning, and her eyes were dimmed with tears, and
so no wonder, she thought, that the objects around
should seem distorted; nor was it till she stretched
out her hand to pluck the roses that she perceived
her lovely tree despoiled of its glorious bloom.
Bare, mutilated, unsightly she beheld it; not a bud
left to tell of what had been, not a single blossom for
the hand of filial love to cast upon the sacred place
of the dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who could have done this cruel deed? She recollected
her rencontre with the woman Grayson—she
remembered her guilty look, and the quick, yet
stealthy, pace with which she passed her, and to her
mind the question was answered beyond a doubt.
The coming day was the anniversary of her mother’s
death, and must it pass unmarked by the only
outward tribute it was in her power to render to her
memory? Thought after thought passed through
her mind as she stood silent before her desolated
tree, but the misfortune was irreparable, and sadly
she returned at last to the bedside of her father—he
was sleeping calmly, his respiration was free and natural,
and the kind neighbor who watched with her,
composed her by the assurance that “the fit was
over and the morning would find him mending;”
still at short intervals he woke, and the same question,
“Are they <span class='it'>all</span> gone?” was constantly repeated,
and then with an imploring tone he would ask for
“but one bud, to speak to him of her.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Alicia de Rochemont stood, as on the reader’s first
introduction to her, before the tall mirror which reflected
back her youthful and lovely figure, arrayed
as when we before beheld her, yet with more care
and precision, for this was the night of the long-expected
fancy-ball, and as the Goddess of Flowers,
her head was crowned with garlands of living and
fragrant roses, her snowy arms were wreathed with
them, and the artificial blossoms that had before
filled her cornucopia, were replaced by the most
delicious flowers of the conservatory, among which
roses of snowy whiteness predominated, lending
their pearly lustre and exquisite fragrance to the
whole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The toilette of the young beauty had been for
some time completed, and a few admiring friends
were now gathered to witness and approve its <span class='it'>tout
ensemble</span>, among whom was Captain Clairville, the
assiduous attendant, though not as yet the declared
lover, of Miss De Rochemont. The dress of the
young lady elicited the commendation of all—for who
could censure what was in such perfect taste? But
above all, the lovely profusion of roses, which lent
to it such a chaste and elegant effect, were especially
admired, and many inquiries arose as to where she
could have procured them—“such unique roses as
they were”—“so unlike any they had ever seen,”
etc.; questions which an innate feeling of shame forbade
Alicia to answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her refusal to tell where she had obtained them,
and indeed her evident desire to avoid the subject,
a little excited the curiosity of Captain Clairville, and
awakened some suspicion in his mind that the knowledge
would not redound greatly to her credit. This
doubt, however, he scarcely admitted to himself,
but it determined him, before finally committing his
happiness to the keeping of his fair Alicia, to study
her character more closely, and as a key to it, discover
if possible the story, for he was sure there was
one, connected with the roses; but for this evening
he would strive to dismiss distrust, and enjoy the
beauty and vivacity which had almost completed
their conquest over him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this resolution he was just preparing to depart
for his lodgings and dress for the ball, when a
violent ringing at the street-door, and then a bustle
in the hall, attracted the attention of the little circle.
The servants were heard endeavoring to prevent
some one from entering, and then steps sounded on
the stairs and the tones of a woman’s voice—such
tones as issue from the broken chords of a crushed
heart—came nearer and nearer, till they paused at
the very door of the dressing-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Clairville arose and threw it open, when
a slight figure, wrapped in a gray Canadian cloak,
crossed the threshold and stood within the lighted
room—but when she saw herself reflected in the large
mirror opposite the door she started and seemed for
a moment on the point of retreating, then, as if suddenly
taking courage, she threw back the hood
which covered her head, revealing the delicate and
spiritual face of Rosalie La Motte. Casting a quick,
but earnest gaze round the room, her eye rested on
Alicia, radiant as the goddess she personated, who
stood watching with interest the motions of the intruder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an instant the girl’s gaze seemed fascinated by
so bright a vision, then with an agitation visible in
her whole frame, she rapidly crossed the floor and
paused before the <span class='it'>fauteuil</span> in which sat Madame de
Rochemont. That lady’s native boldness and hauteur
seemed to desert her at the appearance of the
young girl—her face grew scarlet through her rouge,
and her manner exhibited the utmost disorder and
embarrassment. Grayson, on the contrary, who
stood behind her mistress, assumed a look of fierce
defiance when the object she had so wantonly
wronged unexpectedly presented herself. But Rosalie,
regardless of every thing save the one purpose
she had come hither to accomplish, addressed
herself immediately with the utmost simplicity and
directness to Madame de Rochemont.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You remember, Madame,” she said, “the object
of your visit to me this morning, but perhaps you
are not aware that after your departure your servant,
having informed herself of my absence, stole
back and rifled my precious rose-tree! There are
its flowers,” pointing to Alicia, “and I have come
to ask that they may be restored to me. They did
not bloom for the brow of beauty, but have been
watered with tears and cherished for the departed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grayson,” said Madame de Rochemont, fanning
herself violently, and without deigning a reply to
Rosalie—“Grayson, she is a mad creature—ring the
bell and bid Atkins take her away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me, Madame, if I countermand your
order,” said Captain Clairville. “Let us, at least,
give this young girl a fair hearing before we judge
and send her away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosalie raised her soft eyes, full of gratitude, toward
him, and that speaking look strengthened his
resolve to see that amends were made her for the
injury of which she complained. Rosalie, without
heeding this interruption, resumed her pleading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is for my father’s sake, Madame, that I desire
these flowers—they are associated in his mind
with my mother, and now that his intellect is wandering—that
he is dying—for oh, I fear it is so, he
bids me bring them to him that he may have
peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How absurd!” ejaculated Madame de Rochemont—“the
girl is an impostor, and has some end
to serve by such behavior.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Madame, the scene you witnessed this morning
must assure you of my truth,” said Rosalie, tears
which she could no longer restrain falling from her
eyes—“I ask only for one cluster of those roses that
I may lay them on my father’s pillow, and see him
smile upon me in his last moments.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is money, girl,” said Madame de Rochemont,
with the coarseness which characterized her,
“but the flowers form an important part of my
daughter’s dress and I will not consent to its being
spoiled for such a whim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this insult Rosalie could no longer command
herself—a bright blush of wounded pride and shame
overspread her face, and covering it with both
hands she bowed down her head and wept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Clairville, indignant at the treatment she
received, felt all his sympathies enlisted in her behalf,
and as respectfully as he would have addressed
a duchess he approached, and with a few soothing
words endeavored to draw her toward a seat, for he
saw that she was too much overcome to stand. She
however resisted his effort, but the interest he thus
expressed for her aroused the wrath of Madame de
Rochemont, who loaded the poor girl with the most
opprobrious epithets, while the sullen mood of Alicia
changed to open resentment. Throwing down her
cornucopia, and tearing from her arms and head the
rose-wreaths that encircled them, she flung them
scornfully upon the floor, darting, at the same time,
such looks of anger at Captain Clairville, as forced
him to the inward conviction that his bright mistress
would better personate one of the Furies than any
gentler deity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Grayson saw the roses she had taken such
unworthy pains to obtain, cast angrily away, she
quite forgot where she was, and rushing forward
she caught them up, declaring that “her young lady
should not be cheated out of her roses by the false
tears and impudence of that beggarly girl.” Terrified
by the evil passions which were producing such
a scene of confusion around her, the gentle Rosalie
began to look almost with indifference on the precious
roses, which lay withering in the heated air
of the apartment. Their pure leaves had been nurtured
by tender tears and loving smiles, and now that
the hot breath of envy and resentment had breathed
on them, they seemed to her no longer the same,
and all unworthy to shed fragrance on the couch of
the dying, or lend beauty to the place of the dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must be gone,” she said to Captain Clairville,
who still remained near her—“my father will miss
me—but I care no longer for the flowers—let her
wear them, they are fitter now for joy and beauty
than for sorrow and death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was fearfully agitated—her frame trembled—her
face was deathly pale—unaccustomed to such
outbursts of the lower passions, their exhibition, invoked
by herself, filled her with terror; she betrayed
a nervous anxiety to escape, like one in a den of ferocious
animals, and shrank close to the side of Captain
Clairville as she moved toward the door, seemingly
afraid to go forward alone. When about to descend
the stairs he saw her falter, and supported her to the
hall, but before they reached it she had fainted.
Ferris stood there with her bonnet and shawl on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a cariole at the door, sir,” she said, “I
will go with her, I know the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear you will lose your situation, my good girl,
if you take the part of this poor young thing,” said
Captain Clairville.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall not mind, sir; there are plenty more as
good,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are, Ferris,” he replied, “and you shall
not suffer for your kindness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have snatched this for the poor child,” she
said, when they were seated in the cariole, lifting
the corner of her shawl and showing the garland of
roses which had encircled Alicia’s head. “I felt
sure her young heart was breaking to leave the
flowers she loved trampled under foot, sir, and so I
brought away this to comfort her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Clairville smiled approval, but had not
time to reply, as the driver stopped just then at the
door of the old house in which Rosalie dwelt. The
air had revived her, but in her pallid cheek and faltering
step were visible the effects of the scene
through which she had just passed—anxiety for her
father seemed now to absorb every other thought,
and with a rapidity which her companions could
scarcely equal, she ascended the stairs, and pushing
open the door of the still and darkened room, advanced
with a noiseless step to the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman she had left with him still remained
at her post, but her look was solemn, and as she
raised and then silently moistened the sick man’s
lips with a drop of water, she shook her head with
a significance which seemed to say there was no
longer room for hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You cannot mean that he is worse!” cried Rosalie,
alarmed by her manner. “He is sleeping
calmly, and I perceive no change since I left him.”
And bending over him she pressed her lips fondly on
his cheek. Its marble coldness startled her, and she
raised her eyes with a glance of agony to the kind
face of the woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is true child!” she said in reply to that look;
“he will soon be gone, and may God comfort the
fatherless!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A wild burst of sorrow escaped the poor girl at
this confirmation of her worst fears, and she laid her
cheek on that of the dying, bathing it with her tears
and kisses. That cry—the touch of those fond lips,
arrested the departing spirit in its flight. The closing
eyes opened and fastened themselves with a look
of inexpressible tenderness on the face of his child—then
they were raised upward with a radiant smile
that spoke of peace and blessedness—but immediately
a mysterious shadow passed over the countenance,
and as it settled down upon it the spirit quitted
its frail tenement, but left its heavenly impress
in the smile which lingered long upon the pallid lips.</p>

<hr class='tbk121'/>

<p class='pindent'>The dull, gray morning dawned slowly on that
chamber of death shedding a cold light upon the forlorn
rose-tree, and stealing, as with a muffled step,
to the bed on which reposed, beside her dead father,
the youthful form of the gentle, heart-broken daughter.
Long after his departure she had seemed to
sleep calmly on his bosom, but when they raised her
up, to remove her from him, the seal of death was
on her angel features—this last sorrow had been too
mighty for her poor, tried heart, and in the bitter
struggle its chords snapped, and its music was forever
hushed on earth, to make glad melody in heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Clairville saw the last duties paid to the
remains of the departed father and daughter, whose
sad history had awakened his deepest interest, and
whose prospects, had their lives been spared, it was
his hope and purpose to brighten. The precious
rose-tree he consigned to the charge of Ferris, who
shortly afterward married an honest tradesman, exacting
from her a promise to shed its flowers annually
on the graves of those who so fondly cherished it—a
promise which she faithfully fulfilled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Disappointed in his estimate of Alicia’s character,
Clairville never, after the affair of the roses, sought
a renewal of his intercourse with her, and the few
times they met in society, it was as strangers. As
soon as the spring opened he obtained leave of absence
and returned to England, and when he again
rejoined his regiment, he was the husband of a lady,
who, Ferris declared, was the very image of poor
Rosalie La Motte.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mortified and chagrined by his desertion, Alicia
affected a gayety which she did not feel, and pursued
her vain career of dissipation and vanity till the
bloom of youth faded from her cheek, when she gave
her hand to a man double her own age, who was
supposed to be immensely rich. But he shortly
transported her to an isolated seignory, which was
his only possession, where, without any affection for
her husband or any resources within herself, she
lived a wretched and discontented being, and died
unregretted and unwept.</p>

<div><h1><a id='nun'></a>THE LEGEND OF THE WHITE NUN.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY J. POPHAM.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh! pooh!” says the ‘strong-minded lady,’
“who ever believes in legends now-a-days?” and
she turns over our pages to look for a more interesting
article.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Legends! Fudge!” says the practical man,
who may give a supercilious glance at the title, “I
leave such nonsense for old women.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Legend of the White Nun!” reads the sentimental
young miss, or the Byronic gent with curly
hair, and a turned-down shirt-collar—“ah! a story
with a very heart-rending finale, no doubt!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then come the believers in Spirit-Knockings,
and in Winking Madonnas—and they will observe,
“Here again is, doubtless, something which will
corroborate what the skeptical world is pleased to
call superstitions!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am not going now to answer these remarks in
the negative or affirmative. I will not anticipate
the <span class='it'>finale</span>, or inform you at once the character of the
following tale. <span class='it'>That</span> is opposed to all precedent. I
merely ask for a perusal before judgment; and then,
perhaps, the strong-minded lady, and the practical
gentleman, and the sentimental miss, will all find
themselves wrong in their conjectures. A story is,
now-a-days, no more to be judged by its title, than
a hypocrite by his appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this preface, or apology, or left-handed explanation—or
whatever else the reader is pleased to
call it—I shall commence.</p>

<hr class='tbk125'/>

<p class='pindent'>While a young man I was very fond of field sports,
and in the part of England where I then resided, I
had frequent opportunities for indulging in them.
Not only around my immediate neighborhood did I
often saunter with dog and gun, but oftentimes over
the preserves of acquaintances in adjoining parishes.
In the month of November, 1809, I made a visit,
ostensibly for shooting, at the residence of Squire
Primrose, of the village of Tremington, in Devonshire.
I say the object of my visit was ostensibly
to visit the Squire’s fields for pheasant and snipe, but
the real object was to see one of the Squire’s daughters.
I cared more, dear reader, for a smile from
Jane Primrose than for a dozen brace of snipe; and
I am sure I would <span class='it'>then</span> (for I am old and married to
<span class='it'>another</span> now!) have given fifty pheasants for a taste
of her rosy lips. But matters were not then sufficiently
far advanced to avow what is called, in such
cases, “my intentions.” I was accompanied by an
intimate friend, called Bob Turner, or, as one would
now say, (as we style every man from a water-carrier
to a millionaire,) Robert Turner, Esquire!
Strange to relate, Bob was similarly situated toward
Jane’s sister, Elizabeth; and, like me, made
the Squire’s love for game a means for making love
to his daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the evening of our arrival, we, and the family,
assembled in their old-fashioned but comfortable
parlor, before a blazing fire. Here we amused ourselves
in various ways, as young people are wont to
do. After the detail of all the gossip in the neighborhood—how
that Dr. Balden’s wife was said to be
a little too intimate with the parson—how that Miss
Jenkings had been jilted—and that an old maid,
named Smith, had offered herself to her coachman,
and was about to marry him, and so forth; the Squire
took up the newspaper, which weekly made its appearance,
and commenced to read aloud a very extraordinary
ghost story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as he had finished, and our expressions
of surprise had subsided, an old lady in the company—Mrs.
Scroggins—exclaimed, “Well, now, this
reminds me that my man, William, saw the ‘White
Nun’ in the convent grave-yard last night; and she
so frightened him, that he declares he will never
pass there again after dusk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mention of this aroused Bob’s curiosity and
mine. We begged her to give us the history, or the
legend, if any, connected with this mysterious personage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reader, have you ever heard of a gentleman who
was asked in company to sing, and who did not
raise a thousand objections, although he was all the
while dying to exhibit his vocal abilities? Have you
ever seen the lady who was asked to play at a party,
and who did not excuse herself in fifty ways, although
she had been practicing the whole day previous for
the occasion? If <span class='it'>you</span> have, <span class='it'>I</span> have not. Nor have
I ever met with a person who, when called upon for
an anecdote, did not declare it was not worth repeating,
or that he or she was certain it had been heard
before. So it was with Mrs. Scroggins; we had to
beg of her for this legend for about a quarter of an
hour, after which, like the vocalist and the pianist,
under similar circumstances, she consented.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE LEGEND.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The convent of Hickle-path Hill, which two or
three centuries since is said to have presented a very
imposing appearance, is now represented by a few
tottering remnants of walls, which all of you, I suppose,
have often seen on a clear day from the front
window. A little beyond them, to the right, are the
ruins of a castle, which formerly belonged to the
Bassett family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About the latter half of the fifteenth century, Sir
Hugh Bassett occupied the castle, which was then
large and strong. He had a daughter called Agnes,
an only child, and a beautiful girl. She was the admiration
of every one who beheld her, and a standing
toast at every feast in the neighborhood. Her
hair was said to have been raven-black, her eyes dark,
large and sparkling; her cheeks fresh as the leaves
of a full-blown rose; her teeth like pearls; her form
and figure, “stately, like a queen.” At least she was
evidently very pretty; I wont say, for I can’t say,
she realized this description, for it seems as if copied
from the pages of a modern novel—and we know
that there all heroines are alike, superior to any thing
ever seen in this world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lost her mother at an early age—a loss to a
child for which nothing can compensate. The want
of maternal care and teaching was no doubt the cause
of some little peculiarities in her disposition. Being
left much to herself, having none but her father
whom she recognized as her superior, she acquired
a spirit of independence and of firmness of character
which she would not likely have otherwise possessed.
But notwithstanding this, she did not want
many good and kind qualities; and she had a judgment
and discrimination of character by no means
common in those times. To the poor of the neighborhood
she was always kind, and was much admired
by them in return. With many of her own
rank she was reserved, although with others she was
cheerful and communicative. It was remarked that
those whom she seemed to like most were generally
more distinguished for character than rank. She
seemed, to the wonderment of her father’s friends,
to regard many an industrious peasant more than she
did some far-famed baron, with “quarterings” on
his shield. To her parent she always exhibited
affection, and never withheld her respect, even when
she reluctantly bestowed him her submission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Hugh had descended from one who had accompanied
William the Conqueror to England. He
was as proud as he was powerful. He measured
merit by military prowess—virtue, by wealth—and
character, by the length of ancestry; peculiarities
which, we believe, are not altogether unknown at
this day. He loved his daughter more because she
was <span class='it'>his</span> daughter, than for herself; and he estimated
her claim to respect, not so much by her virtues,
as by the Bassett blood which flowed in her veins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fame of the fair Agnes naturally brought her
many admirers and suitors. For a long time her
heart seemed untouched by their looks or addresses.
But no woman’s heart is impregnable! She may
skirmish a great deal, she may act as if about to make
a powerful repulse, she may make seeming preparations
for a terrible encounter, but, if her opponent
has any knowledge of tactics in these matters, and is
otherwise unobjectionable, she will sooner or later
“give-up,” hang down her head, blush up to her
eye-brows, and then, whisperingly utter, “take
me, and be happy!” So Agnes drove off suitor after
suitor. One she frightened by her freezing looks,
which no one better than a woman can assume,
when she chooses. Others she dismissed with a
flat refusal; while some were driven back by her
palpable contempt for their persons. But as time
crept on, a close observer might remark a slight
blush rising on her cheeks when young Rhoderick
Wray made his appearance; and how, by some unaccountable
accident, they would be both found,
soon after his arrival, standing in close converse in
some retired part of the room, or strolling together
upon the balcony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This young man was an adopted son of a neighboring
baron and his lady, whose name he bore.
His real parents were unknown. His adopted
parents found him, while an infant, laid at the foot
of an oak, in Anchor-Wood. Having no children,
they brought him up as their own; and he
never gave them cause to repent of their choice—which
is more than many parents, I fear, can say of
their offspring. At an early age he displayed unusual
sagacity, and a generous disposition. An old
friar, who taught him Latin, and the limited course
of education then pursued, declared that Heaven intended
him for the church; but the Baron thought
otherwise, and intended him for arms. His appearance
corresponded with his character. He had a
manly and a graceful figure, natural and well developed,
not manufactured with wadding, not braced
up by stays, as I hear fashionable men now are. He
had a noble, open forehead, which you always find
in a good man, and a frank and kind expression upon
a handsome face. At an early age he was sent to
the Low Countries, from whence he returned, after
the lapse of five years, bringing with him spurs of
knighthood, wounds and scars. He had been from
his earliest days a visitor at the castle, in company
with his adopted parents, and always received by
Sir Hugh with cordiality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From his youth he was a secret admirer of Agnes.
Before he had entered his teens—during that romance
period of life—he often used to dream of her.
He would at times picture a beautiful castle, situate
in a romantic spot, surrounded by a lovely garden,
interspersed with fountains and grottoes, where he
roamed about by her side, with happiness within,
and beauty above and around. He would then put
eloquently loving language into his mouth, and
listen to an imaginary but equally sweet reply. She
occupied his thoughts when awake. In his studies,
in his devotions, in his walks, she was always next
his heart. But delusions, however sweet, are
transitory. These beautiful fancies would quickly
fade before the substance of reality. The uncertainty
of his origin, the pride and prejudices of her
father would rise to his remembrance, and tear away
all hope of that union which he so ardently longed
for. In moments of despondency he would even
doubt the love of Agnes—for as yet it had not been
asked for or avowed. He sometimes thought, when
they walked together upon a hill opposite her residence,
or rode together in a hawking party, that she
had a feeling deeper than mere partiality toward
him; but this cheering supposition was damped by
the knowledge of the uselessness of her consent,
unless accompanied with her father’s approval.
Nevertheless, he continued to hope against hope.
It requires a great deal to cause the heart to abandon
an object which it has once cherished. He
thought that by perfecting himself in his military
exercises, by acquiring fame in his intended profession,
he might hide the obscurity of his birth, and
render himself, in the eyes of Sir Hugh, a fitting
husband for his daughter. With this impulse to
stimulate he was industrious and zealous in his
duties, and obtained his departure for Flanders sooner
than his adopted parents had intended. <span class='it'>There</span>, he
fulfilled his expectations—he obtained fame for his
prowess, and admiration for his character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon his return from the Low Countries, he was
pleased to find that no rival had apparently supplanted
him in her affection. He was equally pleased in observing
that her manner had lost none of its wonted
cordiality toward him. Her father also treated him
with more respect, and his own friends looked on
him with pride. But these propitious appearances
did not induce him to divulge his secret, but they
encouraged him to renew his former intimacy, so
that he might with greater safety formally offer himself
as a suitor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a woman’s penetrating eye in these matters,
Agnes early had suspicions of his feelings and his
intentions. She liked him before she knew it herself,
and she adroitly gave him opportunities for meeting
her, as if by accident; and he (but much more
clumsily) would, at other times, throw himself in
her way, as if by inadvertence. These intercourses,
in time, displayed each other’s feelings too plainly
for concealment. He offered her his love—she returned
him her heart!</p>

<p class='pindent'>This, the most solemn engagement that man or
woman can make, (but, alas! how often made lightly
and thoughtlessly—how often made in ignorance of
its obligations, in the utter want of its requirements!)
was no sooner completed, than she thought for the
first time about the approval or disapproval of Sir
Hugh. Like Rhoderick, she was afraid to have his
consent demanded at once; and as her lover seemed
growing in his estimation, she deemed delay desirable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the numerous suitors for her hand, was
one whom she disliked more than all the others. He
was noble in rank, and illustrious by descent. He
possessed broad lands and a numerous retinue. Apparently
his manner was agreeable, and his disposition
good. But cruelty seemed to lurk beneath his
mildness, and pride beneath his affability. Such,
however, was the impression he made upon Agnes,
and such he was known to be, among those who
were well acquainted with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From his first visit she endeavored to keep him at
a distance; but the effort was fruitless. He would
intrude himself whenever he saw her with Sir
Rhoderick. A dark shade would pass over his
countenance, whenever he saw them apparently
enjoying themselves. About two months after her
engagement, he repeated his former offer, and again
received a refusal. He therefore waited upon her
father, and attributed his disappointment to Sir
Rhoderick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon this information the old knight became
highly enraged, not so much for her refusal of the
one, as for her acceptance of the other. He stormed
and swore, and then assured his lordship that she
should accept his hand, or none.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the departure of the latter, Agnes was sent
for by her father. He very angrily communicated
the news he had received, and, in an incredulous
tone, asked her if it was true? She replied in the
affirmative, and then attempted to justify her choice.
She tried to urge whatever she could in favor of
him to whom she was betrothed, and in disparagement
of his rival. But this attempt only added
fuel to the flame. He waxed more wroth than
before—he heaped abuse upon her, for accepting
one whom he called of base blood, and threatened
him with death, if he was again found within his
castle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He then entreated for her acceptance of De Burgh.
He brought forward, with all the eloquence he could
master, his wealth, his rank, his ancestry, his influence—but
all in vain. True love is strengthened by
opposition. Every request was met with a determined
refusal. At length he threatened to send her
to a convent if she persisted in her choice, and as
she saw no hope of a connection with her lover, she
accepted the offer. She felt that “a living death”
was preferable to an odious marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The threat was eventually carried into execution.
She was sent to a convent not far distant from her
home, where she at once entered upon her noviciate.
But even there she was not exempted from the disagreeable
importunities of De Burgh. He was frequently
allowed to visit her, in company with her
father, and his entreaties increased with the number
of his visits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Agnes thus led a very miserable life. She
was shut up from her few friends, and from all
sympathy. She dared not confide to the sisters, because
she knew they were in the interest of Sir
Hugh. She therefore looked forward to the period
which would forever inclose her within her cell,
with melancholy satisfaction, as a painful release.
Her nights were occupied in tears and prayers; her
thoughts were bound up with the object of her affection,
and she thus gradually seemed to pine away,
like a delicate flower when bereft of sunshine!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rhoderick heard through a messenger which
Agnes had privately sent him, that their betrothal
had been disclosed to Sir Hugh, and of his consequent
threat and displeasure. The grief this intelligence
occasioned him was much aggravated when
he also learned that she had been sent to a convent,
and that his rival was De Burgh. His adopted
parents now became acquainted with the cause of
his melancholiness, but they felt that a personal remonstrance
with her father was useless, and all they
could do, was to try and soothe him for his loss.
But sympathy is a poor doctor for sincere grief; she
may help to bring hope to the patient, but <span class='it'>that</span> only
aggravates disappointment when she disappears.
The Bible, silence and seclusion are the best balms
for an aching heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That the great and most cherished object of his
life should be snatched away at a moment when he
least expected, when all appearances seemed to
warrant success, was indeed a terrible disappointment.
But with a disinterestedness not oftentimes
observable in men, he thought more of <span class='it'>her</span> suffering
than of <span class='it'>his</span> loss. He felt that his life would be richly
purchased by the securement of her happiness, and
the removal of her suffering. With this object, after
one short internal struggle, he induced his father to
wait upon Sir Hugh, with a resignation of his claim
on Agnes, and a pledge to reside in some foreign land,
provided she was released from confinement and from
the importunities of his rival. The offer was accordingly
made and rejected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The period of her noviciate was now about to
terminate. She had either to become De Burgh’s
wife or a nun. But as there was no hope of the
former, De Burgh formed a plot to carry her away,
and marry her by force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the night previous to the one appointed for its
execution, one of the men whom he had engaged to
assist him, communicated the design to his sweetheart,
a former waiting-maid of Agnes, under a
solemn promise of secrecy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have read, observed Mrs. Scroggins, <span class='it'>par parenthesis</span>,
in a very interesting book, which has just
appeared, entitled “Curiosities of Literature,” by a
Mr. D’Israeli, that in looking over some old letters,
written during the troublous times of Charles I., he
found that those which the writers most strongly
urged to be <span class='it'>burned</span> were most <span class='it'>carefully preserved</span>!
And I must say of my own sex, added she, if you
want them to spread any news faster than usual, you
have only to tell them it is a secret, and beg them
<span class='it'>not</span> to divulge it. You may then be certain of hearing
it in every direction in five minutes afterward.
As a matter of course, the maid above referred to
had no sooner pledged secrecy to her lover, than she
flew to communicate the intelligence to her former
mistress—Agnes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Agnes, unfortunately, treated the disclosure
with disbelief. She said it was wholly improbable
that he would attempt it, and he dared not, if he
could. She thought it so undeserving of notice that
she did not deem it necessary to communicate it to
the Lady Abbess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When night arrived, she departed to rest as usual,
without taking any precautions. She had slept
about two hours, when she was awakened by a
noise on the balcony, and she was surprised by seeing
a man open her window without any apparent
difficulty, and cautiously approach her bed. It was
dark, but she thought at once it was De Burgh. With
fear, shame and indignation struggling in her bosom,
she grasped a small dagger which hung by the bed,
and as he advanced she plunged it into his breast.
A cry of pain burst from his lips, and informed her
that it was her lover, and not his rival, she had stabbed.
She then sprang from her bed, and fell senseless
on the floor!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The noise awoke the abbess and several of the
nuns, and brought them running to her chamber.
With horror they saw the spectacle before them.
They then obtained assistance to carry Rhoderick
to his home, and obtained a leech for Agnes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It appears that De Burgh had employed a man to
assassinate his rival also, while he enjoyed his customary
evening walk on the banks of the beautiful
little river Taw. By an accident which providence
often interposes, he discovered himself at the moment
he was about to strike, and thus enabled his intended
victim to disarm and wound him. While writhing
from agony, and in momentary expectation of death,
he divulged to Sir Rhoderick that he was employed
by De Burgh, who also intended to carry away
Agnes that night to a distant castle, where she
would be confined in a dungeon until she consented
to become his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Collecting a few men, he hastily departed for the
convent, near which he met his opponent. A conflict
ensued, in which De Burgh was killed, and
several of his companions. Ascending the rope
ladder which they had secured to the wall which
supported the balcony leading to her window, he
groped his way into her chamber, for the purpose of
effecting her deliverance. In that endeavor the
fatal mistake occurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly after his removal Agnes became somewhat
restored, but only to relapse into a worse state than
before. In her delirium she would call upon her
lover, in a similar way that any other young lady
would be likely to do under such circumstances.
Very pathetic, no doubt—but as I do not like tragic
scenes, nor tragic descriptions, I must pass over
this part of my story, and allow you to fancy what
took place. However, on the third day of her illness,
while relating portions of her history to a favorite
nun, she suddenly stopped in the midst of her remarks
and gazed intently toward the foot of her bed.
She seemed also to be listening, and then, with the
words, “Yes, I’m coming,” she suddenly but quietly
expired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The persons who attended Sir Rhoderick’s funeral
declared that when his body was about to be lowered
into the grave, in the church, a white shadow was
suddenly seen to enter the building, and reflect itself
upon the coffin. And the nun affirmed it was precisely
at this moment that Agnes died!</p>

<p class='pindent'>This remarkable coincidence excited the wonderment
of his friends, and they accordingly laid it before
a friar who enjoyed a reputation for great learning.
He gave it as a reply, that the white shadow was
the spirit of Agnes, and that on each anniversary of
her lover’s death she would be required, as a penance,
to visit his grave, in a white dress!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tradition says that this duty has been regularly
performed—that on the night of the 7th of November—the
day on which he died—she may be seen
about midnight, walking in this garb toward his
grave, with a rosary in her hand.</p>

<hr class='tbk126'/>

<p class='pindent'>A silence of two or three minutes’ duration followed
the recital of this legend, when Jane expressed
her dissatisfaction with the punishment allotted to
Agnes. She declared it was unjust, because Rhoderick’s
death was the result of a mistake, and in this
opinion she was supported by some others in the
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I, however, boldly expressed my entire disbelief
in ghosts, and in all their species, at the same time
complimenting Mrs. Scroggins for the very eloquent
manner (as the newspapers say) in which she had
narrated her story; for although fearless of spirits, I
had great terror of the old lady’s tongue, and was,
therefore, careful not to draw down her wrath, by
an indiscriminate censure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bob, who prided himself upon his enlightened
opinions, pompously declared that a belief in such
chimeras was the offspring of a weak or ignorant
mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Scroggins hereupon cast on him a very disdainful
look, but did not deign to reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Primrose shook her head, and very mysteriously
declared she had seen too many of such
scenes in her life, to disbelieve them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elizabeth said nothing, but she seemed very much
afraid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Squire was sound asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A lady named Baker, who had hitherto remained
silent, here expressed her opinion that those who
most ridiculed the belief in supernatural appearances,
in daylight or in company, were the most afraid of
meeting them, when alone in any place said to be
haunted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My comrade and myself took this as a challenge.
In the presence of their sweethearts young men
always feign to be brave. The most modest youth
becomes the veriest Falstaff by the side of his lady-love.
We therefore felt it to be our duty to reiterate
our skepticism in the strongest terms, and to
express ourselves ready, if need be, to encounter a
whole army of witches, warlocks, hobgoblins, fairies
and will-o’-the-wisps, if such things existed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The offer seemed to spread terror among our listeners,
and Elizabeth imploringly begged me to say
no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We felt we had made a favorable impression of
our courage, and as the hour was now far advanced,
we made arrangements to rise early on the following
morning for shooting, and then went to our respective
places of rest, with a higher idea of our bravery than
perhaps had Cæsar when he had vanquished Pompey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We rose about five, and started with our guns, etc.
for a noted sporting place, some five miles distant.
It was a clear frosty morning, and in the lightness
and activity of youth, we briskly paced over our
path, and leaped over the gates and hedges which
intercepted the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our sport, however, did not equal our expectation.
We therefore walked two or three miles farther,
where we bagged a few pheasants. We then called
upon an acquaintance, with whom we remained
until 6 <span style='font-size:smaller'>P. M.</span>, and as dusk then began to make its
appearance, we departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It happened that the places through which we had
to pass in our return to the Primroses, were noted for
their connection with witches, and other supernatural
personages. Ruins of old castles, priories, convents
and churches, were to be found in every direction,
each of which was connected with many marvellous
legends. In passing through a lonely spot,
“Anchor Wood,” we found it very dark. We had
no light to guide us, save a few faint rays of the
moon, which glimmered between the trees. As Bob
was best acquainted with the place, I followed on
his trail, Indian fashion, each having our guns carelessly
resting on our shoulders. On we so walked
without saying a word. I, thinking upon the anticipated
amusement of the party which the Primroses
were to give on that evening; and building—like
all young minds do—beautiful castles in the air,
and imagining fame and fortune in the future. In the
midst of these pleasing though delusive reveries, I
was startled, all of a sudden, by a terrified exclamation
from my companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that?” cried he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” I replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean that tall white object which is standing
in front, directly in our path.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked in the direction he pointed, and to my
amazement I saw what he described. It seemed
like a tall lady dressed in white, and she appeared to
be awaiting our approach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is surely the White Nun Mrs. Scroggins
was telling us about last evening,” whispered Bob,
with a face like a white-washed wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I pretended to poh! poh! the conjecture; but I
must confess the attempt was rather a failure. My
courage was rapidly giving way. At last I said,
doubting whether to remain or run, “I’d rather I
had not ridiculed that legend last evening;” and
with an effort to become philosophical, I added,
“that we ought in our present limited amount
of knowledge to treat these things at least with
respect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I wish you had then!” stammered poor
Bob, whose teeth rattled together like a negro-minstrel’s
“<span class='it'>bones</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose we call out, and ask what she wants?”
I suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>You</span> do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’d rather not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was then agreed that we should call together,
which was done; but no reply was returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bob now suggested that we should discharge a
barrel of each of our double-barreled guns obliquely
toward the object, which was likewise done; but it
met no better success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no doubt it is a spirit, perhaps the Nun
in question, who is thus going to upbraid us for our
disbelief,” whispered my friend again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! I see her move! She is advancing—run,”
I cried, flinging away my gun, and setting the
example.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>That</span> was enough to make him follow. Away we
ran over hedges, ditches, amid mud, and brambles,
and water; a small river stretched in front, through
which we could only now reach our destination.
Cold and dark as it was, we did not hesitate a moment,
but plunged in, clothes and all, and swam
across. Ascending the opposite bank, we started
off again, as fast as our legs could carry us, until we
reached the Squire’s residence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We entered, with our garments dripping with
water, and our teeth chattering with cold, without
our caps, guns, or game—with our eyes dilated from
fright, and our faces pale with excitement. The
family and guests had been waiting for us; and you
may conjecture their astonishment when they saw
our condition. Every mouth was accordingly opened
with inquiries; but several minutes elapsed before
we could reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length I stammered that we had met a ghost,
who looked like the nun Mrs. Scroggins had described.
This only increased their curiosity, and
with a little more delay I gave them a very incoherent
narration of what had taken place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Jane! I saw a tear silently trickle from her
eyes while I was pathetically describing our terror
and our danger; and I fancied I saw Elizabeth at
that moment giving Bob a secret but affectionate
squeeze of the hand. All the others were, of course,
amazed, and fully believed every word we said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We then speedily changed our clothes, and
(Father Matthew forgive me!) drank a tumbler of
good brandy and water, which was considered an
infallible remedy against cold. After which we
made our re-appearance in the parlor, feeling like
true-born heroes just escaped from danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment the clergyman of the village arrived.
All of us observed something peculiar in
his manner, and we inquired if he, too, had seen the
nun?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,” said he, “while I was passing through
Anchor-Wood, I saw what appeared to be a lady in
a white dress. I was somewhat startled at this unexpected
appearance, and I hardly knew what conclusion
to arrive at. I thought at first I would return
home, but on second consideration I determined
to proceed. I did so, and to my great surprise and
amusement, I discovered it was no lady at all, and
that the illusion was nothing more than the moon’s
rays reflected from a pool of water!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A roar of laughter, which might have been heard
a mile distant, followed this disclosure. But no
laugh came from Bob’s mouth or mine. No poor
mortals were evermore crest-fallen than we were.
Any one might have pitied us, when they saw how
wofully down in the mouth we became. I tried to
be gay, to enjoy the joke, to alter the current of conversation—but
it was “no go;” only made matters
worse. Mrs. Scroggins made sundry cuts at my
courage, Jane complimented my running, and the
old Squire wanted to know if I usually swam with
my clothes on? With mortification and anger and
shame, I ran in desperation to my bed-room, never
more miserable in my life. For a long, long time
after, nothing gave me greater horror than to hear
the slightest allusion made to the “White Nun!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To be very sure of what he is about to say, and
to say it in the fewest possible words, are golden
rules which every young author should inscribe, in
letters of the same metal, upon the most prominent
panel of his study. Had the Hon. Henry Coke done
this when he stepped out of his stirrup, on his return
from his Ride to California, he would have spared
himself the painful throes which appear to have attended
the commencement of his literary labor—would
have spared his readers, too, the triviality and
platitudes which deface some of the earlier pages of
his otherwise spirited narrative of a most adventurous
expedition. We reckon it amongst the remarkable
and hopeful signs of the times, that young men
of family and fortune voluntarily abandon the luxurious
ease of home for such break-neck and laborious
expeditions as that whose record is before us. Whatever
the faults of the nobles of Great Britain, effeminacy
is certainly not of the number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is, indeed, from no feather-bed journey or carpet-knight’s
tour that Mr. Coke has recently returned.
Take the map, reader, and trace his route.
From England to Jamaica, Cuba, Charleston, New
York and St. Louis, the great and rising capital of
the Western States. We omit the minor intermediate
places at which he touched or paused. Thus
far all was plain sailing and easy civilized travel.
The rough work began when St. Louis was left
behind. Across the wide wastes of Missouri territory,
through the inhospitable passes of the Rocky
Mountains, the traveler passed on to Oregon City and
Fort Vancouver, thence took ship to the Sandwich
Islands, returned to San Francisco, visited the gold
diggings, steamed to Acapulco, rode across Mexico,
and came home to England after an absence of a
year and a half, during which he had been half round
the world and back again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Coke started from St. Louis with two companions:
one an old college friend, whom he designates
as Fred; the other “a British parson, whose
strength and dimensions most justly entitled him to
be called a pillar of the church.” What the parson
did in the prairies of the Far West does not clearly
appear. He certainly did not go as a missionary,
so far as we can ascertain from his friend’s book,
and indeed his habits and tendencies were evidently
sporting and jovial rather than clerical, although we
do catch him reading Sunday prayers to Mr. Coke,
when the latter had the chills, and lay wrapped up
in wet blankets on the banks of Green River, with a
boxful of Brandreth’s pills in his stomach. We regret
to believe that instances <span class='it'>have</span> been known of
parsons employing their time far worse than in an
adventurous ramble across the American continent.
Mr. Coke, nevertheless, thinks proper to veil his
chaplain’s identity under the heroic cognomen of
Julius Cæsar, against which distinguished Roman,
could he be recalled to life, we would unhesitatingly
back the reverend gentlemen to box a round, wrestle
a fall, or handle a rifle, for any number of ponies the
ancient backers might be disposed to post. A stalwort
priest and a powerful was Parson Julius, and
is still, we trust, if nothing has happened to him
since Mr. Coke left him at the court of his majesty
Tamehameha III., at Honolulu, on the eve of setting
sail for the island of Owyhee. No better companion
could be desired on a rough and perilous expedition;
and although his careless friend manages to let his
true name slip out before ending his volume, we
will not allow that the slip affords grounds for regret,
or that there is any thing in his journey of
which, as a clergyman, he need be ashamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Considerably over-provided with attendants, horses,
mules, and, above all, with baggage, the three friends
left St. Louis. Their “following” comprised “four
young Frenchmen of St. Louis; Fils, a Canadian
<span class='it'>voyageur</span>; a little four-foot-nothing Yankee, and
Fred’s <span class='it'>valet-de-champs</span>, familiarly called Jimmy.”
The journey was commenced on the 28th of May,
1850, per steamer, up the Missouri. On the morning
of the 29th a disagreeable discovery was made.
Fils, the guide, had disappeared. The scamp had
levanted in the night; how, none could tell. Drowning
was suggested; but as he had taken his baggage,
and had forgotten to leave behind him the rifle and
three months’ advance of pay which he had received
from his employers, the hypothesis was contemptuously
scouted. Consoling themselves with the reflection
that his desertion would have been far more
prejudicial at a later period of their journey, the travelers
continued their progress up the Missouri (for
whose scenery Mr. Coke can find no better comparison
than the Cockney one of “Rosherville or Cremorne”)
to St. Joseph, which the Yankees familiarize
into <span class='it'>St. Joe</span>. Here they were to exchange the
deck for the saddle; and so impatient were they for
the substitution that they actually felt “annoyed at
being obliged to sleep another night on board the
steamer.” They had yet to learn the value of a
coarse hammock in a close cabin. At last they made
a fair start:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>3d June.</span>—After much bother about a guide, and
loss of linch-pins, fitting of harness, kicking and jibbing
of mules, etc., we left the Missouri, and camped
five miles from the town. We pitched our tents in
a beautiful spot, on the slope of a hill, surrounded by
a large wood. A muddy little stream ran at the bottom.
To this (with sleeves turned up and braces
off trying, I suppose, to look as much like grooms
or dragoons as we were able) we each led our
horses: no doubt we succeeded, for we felt perfectly
satisfied with every thing and every body. The
novelty put us all in excellent humor. The potatoes
in the camp-kettle had a decidedly bivouacking
appearance; and though the grass was wet, who, I
should like to know, would have condescended to
prefer a camp-stool? As to the pistols, and tomahawks,
and rides, it was evident that they might be
wanted at a moment’s notice, that it would have
been absolutely dangerous not to have them all in
perfect readiness. Besides, there was a chance of
finding game in the wood. If the chance had been
a hundred times as diminutive, we were in duty
bound to try it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Playing at traveling, like playing at soldiers, is all
very well when the campaign is brief. The raw recruit
or amateur campaigner plumes himself on a
night passed upon straw in a barn. Give him a
week’s bivouacking in damp ploughed fields, and he
sings small and feels rheumatic, and prefers the domestic
nightcap to the warrior’s laurel. Thus with
Messrs. Coke and Company. They were in a monstrous
hurry to begin gypsying. What would they
not have given, a week or two later, for a truckle
bed and a tiled roof? The varnish of the picture,
the anticipated romance, was soon rubbed off by the
rough fingers of hardship and reality. What a start
they made of it! Mr. Coke is tolerably reserved on
this head; but through his reserve it is not difficult
to discern that, unless they had taken hair powder
and a grand piano, they could hardly have encumbered
themselves with more superfluities than those
with which their mules and wagons were overloaded.
Many who read these lines will remember
the admirable and humorous account given by our
lamented friend Ruxton, of the westward-bound
caravan which fell in with Killbuck and La Bonté
at the big granite block in Sweet Water Valley.
Few, who have ever read, will have forgotten that
characteristic sketch;—the dapper shooting-jackets,
the fire-new rifles, the well-fitted boots and natty
cravats, the Woodstock gloves and elaborate powder-horns,
the preserved soup, hotch-potch, pickles,
porter, brandy, coffee, sugar, of the amateur back-woodsmen
who found the starving trappers dining
on a grilled snake in the heart of the Rocky Mountains,
and generously ministered to their necessities.
With somewhat similar, but still more extravagant
provision, did our Jockey of Norfolk, Fred, and
Julius Cæsar, go forth into the prairie. Less fortunate
than Ruxton’s Scotchman, they failed to
retain or enjoy what they had dearly paid for.
Sadly altered was their trim, piteous their plight,
long, long before they reached the Rocky Mountains.
Disasters soon arrived, with disgust and discord
in their train. At their first halting-place, five
miles from St. Joseph, a pouring rain, pattering on
their tent, forbade sleep; a horse and mule, disgusted
by the dirty weather and foretaste of rough work,
broke loose and galloped back to the town. These
recovered, and the new guide, successor to the
faithless Fils, having joined, they again went ahead.
We may cull from Mr. Coke’s pages a few of the
impediments and annoyances encountered at this
early period of the journey:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing could be more provoking than the behavior
of our teams; each animal seemed to vie
with its yoke-mate in making itself disagreeable.
They had no idea of attempting to pull together,
and all exertions on our parts were discouraged by
the most vehement kicks and plunges on theirs.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The men were as incapable of driving as the mules
were unwilling to be driven, and before we had
traveled three miles the heaviest of our wagons was
stuck fast.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A doubt here arose as to which
road we had better take, and I clearly perceived
that our guide was deplorably ignorant of his calling,
since in the very outset he was undecided as to
which route we should pursue.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>7th June.</span>—Started
at seven. Roads worse than ever. Heavy
wagon, as usual, sticks in a rut, and is nearly upset.
Discharge cargo, and find it hard work to carry
heavy boxes up the hill.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My black mare,
Gipsy, has run away. Take Louis, the Canadian,
and go after her. Find her tracks in a large wood,
and hunt the whole day in every direction, but are
at last obliged to give her up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Incidents such as these, and others still more disagreeable,
were of daily occurrence. Nothing could
tame the wilfullness of the mules, or check the erratic
propensities common to them and to the horses.
The wagons, overladen, continually broke down.
Indeed, so aggravating were most of the circumstances
of the journey in this its early stage, and so
few the compensating enjoyments, that we believe
most persons in the place of Mr. Coke and his
friends would have turned back within the week,
and desisted from an expedition which had been
undertaken solely with a view to amusement and
excitement. With extraordinary tenacity of purpose
the three Englishmen persevered. Their followers
proved terribly helpless, and they were
indebted to an old Mormon, whom they met upon
the road, for the repairs of their frequently broken
wheels. Here is the journal for the 12th June:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blazard (the Mormon) repairs our wheels. We
three go out hunting in different directions. See
the tracks and skin of a deer, also fresh tracks of
wolves. Put up a wild turkey—horse too frightened
to allow me to fire at it. Killed a large snake
marked like a rattlesnake, and shoot a gray squirrel
and two wild ducks, right and left, with my rifle.
When we came home we made a bargain with Blazard,
letting him have the small wagon for fifteen
dollars, on condition that he took 300 lb. weight for
us as far as the mouth of the Platte. We talk of
parting with four of our men, and packing the mules,
when we get to Council Bluffs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This project was soon put into execution. There
the travelers camped, at about four miles from the
river; and Mr. Coke and Fred rode over to Trader’s
Point, crossed the Missouri, and called on Major
Barrow, an Indian agent, who cashed them a bill,
recommended them a half-breed servant, bought
their remaining wagon and harness at an “alarming
sacrifice;” bought of them also “forty pounds of
powder, a hundred pounds of lead, quantities of odds
and ends, and all the ginger beer!!!” They had
previously sent back or sold several hundred pounds’
weight of lead and provisions; so we get some idea
of the scale on which the young gentlemen’s stores
had been laid in. By this time, Mr. Coke says,
“we begin to understand the mysteries of ‘trading’
a little better than formerly; but somehow or other
a Yankee always takes us in, and that, too, in so
successful a manner as to leave the impression that
we have taken <span class='it'>him</span> in.” Besides buying their goods
a dead bargain, the Major—a remarkably smart man,
who doubtless thought that greenhorns capable of
taking ginger beer to the Rocky Mountains were fair
game—attempted to make money out of them in another
way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The day cleared, and as we could not start till
the evening, the Major proposed to get up a race.
He knew of a horse (his own) that could beat any in
our ‘crowd.’ He had seen him run a good many
times, and ‘just knowed how he could shine.’ Fifty
dollars was the stake, and ‘let him what won take
the money.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fred volunteered to ride a fast little gray of Mr.
Coke’s. Three-quarters of a mile were measured
on the prairie. The Major brought out his animal,
greased its hoofs, washed its face, brushed its hair,
mounted the half-breed upon it barebacked, and took
his station at the winning-post. At first the half-breed
made the running. Major and friends were
cock-a-hoop; but the Englishman was a bit of a
jockey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were now about three hundred yards from
the post. Fred had never used the spur; he needed
but to slack the reins—away dashed the little gray,
gaining at every stride upon the old horse. It is our
turn to cheer! The Major begins to think seriously
of his fifty dollars, when, in an instant, the fate of
the game is changed. The little gray stumbles; he
has put his foot in a hole—he staggers, and with difficulty
recovers himself. The big horse must win.
Now for whip and spur! Neck and neck, in they
come—and which has won the race? ‘Well, sir!’
said the Major, ‘slick work, wasn’t it? what is
your opinion?’ I might have known by this deferential
question what his opinion was; but, to tell
the truth, I could not decide which horse was the
winner, and so I said. He jumped at this favorable
decision on my part, and ‘calculated’ forthwith that
it was a dead heat. I learned afterward that he had
confessed we had won, and thought little of our
‘smartness’ for not finding it out. My little gray
was thenceforth an object of general admiration;
and the utilitarian minds of the Yankees could not
understand why I was not traveling through the
States with such a pony, and making my fortune by
backing him against every thing of its size.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Coke is a good appreciator of the Yankees,
and so lively and successful in his sketches of their
national traits and peculiarities, that it is to be regretted
he does not talk rather more about them.
His stay at New York he passes over in a couple of
pages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not ambitious,” he says, “of circulating
more American notes, nor do I care to follow in the
footsteps of Mrs. Trollope. Enough has been written
to illustrate the singularities of second-rate American
society. Good society is the same all the world
over. General remarks I hold to be fair play. But
to indulge in personalities is a poor return for hospitality;
and those Americans who are most willing
to be civil to foreigners, receive little enough encouragement
to extend that civility, when, as is too often
the case, those very foreigners afterward attempt to
amuse their friends on one side of the Atlantic, at the
expense of a breach of good faith to their friends on
the other.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have a great respect for almost
every thing American. I do not mean to say that I
have any affection for a thorough-bred Yankee, in
our acceptation of the term; far from it. I think
him the most offensive of all bipeds in the known
world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The English are perhaps too apt to judge a whole
nation upon a few unfavorable specimens; also to
attach exaggerated importance to trifling peculiarities.
This latter tendency is fostered, in the case of
America, by those relentless book-makers, who, to
point a chapter and raise a laugh, are ready, as Mr.
Coke justly remarks, to sacrifice a friend and caricature
facts. In our opinion, Englishmen and Americans
will like each other better when they see each
other more. “All Americans I have met,” says
Mr. Coke, “were agreeable enough if humored a little,
and perfectly civil if civilly treated.” Brutes and
ruffians (like good society) are the same in all countries.
At Sacramento, Mr. Coke one day took up a
newspaper to read an account of a Lynch execution
which had taken place at four that morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was perusing the trial, when a ruffianly-looking
individual interrupted me with, ‘Say, stranger,
let’s have a look at that paper, will you?’ ‘When
I have done with it,’ said I, and continued reading.
This answer would have satisfied most Christians
endowed with any moderate degree of patience; but
not so the ruffian. He bent himself over the back
of my chair, put one hand on my shoulder, and with
the other held the paper, so that he could read as
well as I. ‘Well, I guess you’re reading about Jim,
aint you?’ ‘Who’s Jim?’ said I. ‘Him as they
hung this morning,’ he answered, at the same time
resuming his seat. ‘Jim was a particular friend of
mine, and I helped to hang him.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The narrative that follows, and which is rather
too lengthy to extract entire, is very graphic and
striking—an excellent specimen of life in California.
Jim, it appeared, was a “Britisher,” an ex-convict
from the penal settlements, a terrible scamp and desperado.
His offenses were many, but murder was
the crime he suffered for. Here is the horribly
thrilling account of his execution, as given to Mr.
Coke by the “friend” who helped to Lynch him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was just about daylight. They carried him
to the horse-market, set him on a table, and tied the
rope round one of the lower branches of a big elm-tree.
All the time I kept by his side, and when he
was getting on the table he asked me to lend him
my revolver to shoot one of the jurymen, who had
spoken violently against him. When I refused, he
asked me to tie the knot so as it wouldn’t slip. ‘It
aint no account,’ said I, ‘to talk in that way, Jim;
old fellow, you’re bound to die; and if they didn’t
hang you I’d shoot you myself.’ ‘Well, then,’
said he, ‘give me hold of the rope, and I’ll show
you how little I care for death.’ He seized the
cord, pulled himself in an instant out of the reach of
the crowd, and sat cross-legged on the bough. Half-a-dozen
rifles were raised to bring him down, but
reflecting that he could not escape, they forebore to
fire. He tied a noose in the rope, put it round his
neck, slipped it up till it was pretty tight, and then
stood up and addressed the mob. He didn’t say
much, except that he hated them all. He cursed the
man he shot; he then cursed the world; and last of
all he cursed himself; and with a terrible oath he
jumped into the air, and with a jerk that shook the
tree swung backward and forward over the heads of
the crowd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are cantering rather ahead of Mr. Coke and
his friends, whom we left at Trader’s Point, with a
long trail before them. Their councils were already
divided. The members of the triumvirate could not
agree as to how many of their attendants should be
retained. Finally, most of them were paid off and
sent back. This was a very painful and arduous
part of the journey. On the second day after leaving
Major Barrow’s station, they reached Elk Horn
ferry. It had been broken up by the Indians, and a
raft had to be made, and the baggage taken across
piecemeal. “The animals were not so easy to get
across. Some of us were obliged to swim the river
(which was sixty or seventy yards wide) eight or
nine times, taking one horse at a time, or driving
two or three by flogging and shouting behind them.”
The musquetoes were in the ascendant; the rains
heavy and frequent; the Sioux Indians, it was reported,
had received from the Pawnees intimation
of the movements of the Pale-face band.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the party rather out of sorts,” writes Mr.
Coke on the 26th June. “Our two best men, Louis
and Jim, are very unwell. Nelson, a most willing
and hard-working fellow, is unused to the sort of
life, and wants to turn back. As to Jacob, his utter
uselessness is a constant source of provocation to
me; and the parson’s indifference, and Fred’s fidgetty
disposition, make the chapter of our miseries complete.
The mules are not much better off than we
are; five of them are suffering from severe back-sores,
and all of them object strongly to carrying the
packs; they frequently cast themselves in the night,
and get their legs badly cut with the picket ropes.
It seems after all doubtful how far we shall get.
Some of us talk of going on alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trials of temper are inseparable from expeditions
of this kind, and here was a trio manifestly ill-assorted;
one of its members rather fanciful and capricious,
another too phlegmatic and easy-going, the third—Mr.
Coke, could not be expected to set forth his own
failings, but we suspect him of being a little irritable
and hot-tempered, although evidently a good fellow,
with plenty of pluck and perseverance. As yet,
however, there was no break-up. The party kept
together, often in straggling order, but usually reuniting
at evening, to feed on rancid ham, mouldy
biscuit, and such flesh or fowl as their rifles had procured
them during the day. Nor were fish and reptiles
despised when obtainable. Occasional attempts
at angling were not very fortunate, the American
fish being apparently unused to English flies; but
sometimes a fine salmon or two were got by barter,
from the Indians who had speared them. And a
roast snake is by no means a despicable thing. Both
Mr. Coke and the Parson—for whom we entertain
an intense respect, as a man of few words but energetic
action, a little tardy to move, perhaps, (a slight
dash of Athelstane the Unready in his character,) but
most effective and vigorous when movement was
decided upon—went a snaking now and then. He
of Norfolk seems to have been a fair shot at starting,
and a first-rate one before he had half got over his journey,
and he stalked the buffalo very successfully,
shot snakes through the head, and contributed a large
quota to the contents of the camp-kettle. The chaplain
also was considerable of a sportsman, and ready
with his rifle. Fat cow, tender loin, and juicy hump
at times were plentiful in camp. Failing those delicate
viands, all was made game of that offered itself
to the wanderers’ muzzles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>12th July.</span>—Shot two prairie dogs. Jim killed a
hare and rattle-snake. They were all capital eating,
not excepting the snake, which the parson cooked
and thought as good as eel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Following a band of buffaloes, Mr. Coke was
charged by a bull, and awaited his onset, but waited
a little too long. “My horse never stirred; I had
no time for any thing but to take aim, and having
fired between the neck and shoulder, I was the next
minute, sprawling on my back, with the mare rolling
over four or five yards beyond me. Recovering
from the shock, I could not help admiring the picturesque
group we presented; I rubbing my bruised
limbs, and the buffalo looking on, half stupefied and
astonished at the result of his charge.” The contents
of the rifle’s second barrel roused the bull from
his stupefaction, and he moved off. Up came the
unfeeling parson and followed the wounded brute,
perfectly heedless of his friend’s mishaps. Quite a
man of business was this parson. Mr. Coke gives a
description of his appearance in the prairies, on the
occasion of his purchase of an Indian pony fourteen
hands high. “He weighs fifteen stone, rides on a
heavy saddle with a heavy pair of holster pistols,
carries a very heavy rifle and telescope, a heavy
blanket and great-coat, a pouch full of ammunition,
a girdle stuck with small arms and bowie-knives,
and always has his pockets crammed with <span class='it'>et
ceteras</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not altogether the right costume for a stall in a
cathedral, although highly appropriate upon the trail
to California.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Incompatibility of taste and temper at last produced
a split in the caravan. Fred went on ahead, expecting
to march thirty or thirty-five miles a day. Mr.
Coke and the parson kept together, proposing to limit
their daily progress to twenty-five miles. It was
much oftener sixteen or eighteen, sometimes only
seven or ten. The men hired for the journey had
become so mutinous and discontented, and, upon the
whole, were of so little use, that to two of them a
share of the provisions were given, and they were
allowed to go alone. Two others marched with
Fred, the fifth and last went alone, but occasionally
joined company with Mr. Coke and the parson, who
were otherwise without attendants, and who had
eleven animals to drive and look after—“an awful
number for two men,” especially when they were
unused to horse-driving and to the management of
the abominably vicious, obstinate, perverse brutes
of mules, which were constantly kicking off their
loads, biting their masters, and straying from camp.
The first day’s march after the separation was
the most unpleasant they had yet had. The rain
fell in chilling torrents; a little black mule, the vixen
of the party, kicked Mr. Coke to the ground; and a
gray one, her rival in mischief, who bit like a dog,
made a furious attack upon his calves. The distance
accomplished was but six miles. There were
worse times coming, however, even than these.
The trouble occasioned by the mules and horses was
soon diminished by the loss of three or four of them,
strayed, stolen, or foundered. The country was
barren and inhospitable, and destitute of game, and
often grass and water were for long distances unobtainable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our provisions are barely sufficient to last, with
the greatest economy, to Fort Hall, even at the rate
we are traveling now. Should the horses give up,
it will be impossible for us to carry enough food to
reach that station on foot.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The only way to get
out of the scrape was to lighten the burden of the
pack-mules, by throwing away every ounce of superfluous
weight. Turning out the contents of our
bags on the ground, we selected such things only as
were absolutely necessary to existence. What with
lead, bullets, powder, geological specimens, and old
clothes, we diminished our load so as to make one
pack out of two, and left the ground strewed with
warnings for future emigrants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sand, sage-bushes, and weeds uneatable by the
horses, were now the chief productions of the country.
Wood for fires was often lacking; raw ham is
heating and unsatisfactory food; the sun was blazing
hot, and its rays were fiercely reflected from the
sand. Mr. Coke lost his appetite, and suffered much
from weakness. At last matters mended a little.
They came to a succession of small streams; caught
some trout, and obtained other fresh provisions; fell
in with trappers, and with an express dispatch from
Oregon to the States, escorted by twelve soldiers.
These had come by the same road the Englishmen
were about to travel, and the Boss, or head man of
the party, furnished information concerning grass,
water, and halting-places. From Fort Hall, he told
them, they were still two hundred miles, and from
Oregon nine hundred! A trifling distance in railroad-furrowed
Europe, but oh! what a weary way in
yonder arid wastes, with those fractious mules, and
amidst incessant toils and hardships. “No one,”
says Mr. Coke, “can form any idea of the real length
of <span class='it'>one</span> mile till he has traveled a thousand with pack-mules.”
By this time, for various reasons, the travelers
had given up the idea of going straight to
California, and had fixed upon Oregon as their destination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>October 1st.</span>—This month, please God, will see
us through. The animals, I am sure, will not survive
another. As for ourselves, we have but few
provisions. The season, too, is getting late; and if
we are out much longer, I fear we shall suffer
greatly from cold. Already a blanket and a buffalo-robe
are little enough covering for the nights. My
buffalo-robe, which I spread over the blanket, is
always frozen quite stiff.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yesterday I met with
a disaster, which distresses me exceedingly; I broke
my pipe, and am able neither to repair nor to replace
it. Julius has one, the fumes of which we are compelled
to share. If this should go, (and it is already
in four pieces, and bound up like a mummy,) I
tremble to think of the consequences. In all our
troubles the pipe is the one and only consolation.
<span class='it'>4th.</span>—Oh, how cold it was this morning, and how
cold it was in the night! I could not sleep for the
cold, and yet I dreaded the approach of daylight, and
the tugging at the frozen ropes which it entailed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Our poor beasts actually cringed when the saddle
touched the great raws on their backs; the frost had
made them so painful.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It seems as if this sort
of life was to last forever. Day follows day, without
the slightest change.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Things got worse and worse. One after the other,
the animals perished. By-and-by Mr. Coke found
himself a-foot. They had nothing to eat but salt
meat and salmon, and little enough of that. “Yesterday
I tightened my belt to the last hole; we are
becoming more and more attenuated; and the waist
of my gigantic companion is almost as delicate as
that of a woman.” At last, on the 12th October, in
rags, and with two mules alone remaining out of
their once numerous team, but still of good courage
and in reviving spirits, Mr. Coke and Julius reached
the Dalles, a military post in Oregon, where they
found Fred, who had arrived two days before them,
and received a kind welcome and good treatment
from the officers of the garrison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a few days’ repose at the Soldier’s House, as
the post at the Dalles is called, the three friends,
who had again joined company, boated down the
Columbia. This was a rather amusing part of their
expedition. The boat was manned by a Maltese
sailor and a man who had been a soldier in the American
army. The only passenger besides themselves
was a big officer of the Yankee Mounted Rifles, a
regular “heavy,” and awful braggadocio, who
boasted continually of himself, his corps, his army
and its campaigns. What were the Peninsular campaigns
to the Mexican war? Talk of Waterloo!
Look at Chepultapec. Wellington could not shine
in the same crowd with General Scott. All this
vastly amused the Englishmen. What was less
amusing was the utter ignorance of seamanship displayed
by the soldier-skipper, who, as part owner
of the boat, assumed the command. They were
nearly swamped by his clumsiness, and Mr. Coke,
who has served in the navy, was obliged to take the
rudder. The rudder broke, the wind freshened, the
river was rough, the boat drifted into the surf and
narrowly escaped being dashed to splinters on the
rocks. They drew her up high and dry on the
beach, lit a fire and waited for the storm to blow
over. Wrangling ensued. The Yankee, who had
got drunk upon his passengers’ whisky, swore that,
soldier though he was, he knew as much about boat-sailing
as any midshipman or post-captain in the
British navy. The “heavy” backed him, and the
military skipper swore he would be taught by none,
and wound up with the stereotyped Yankee brag,
that “his nation could whip all creation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had been laughing so much at his boasting
that he doubtless thought himself safe in accompanying
the remark with an insolent look of defiance.
But what was his surprise when the parson, usually
a most pacific giant, suggested that if Fred would
take the Maltese, I the amphibious captain, he himself
would with great pleasure thrash the mounted
rifle, and so teach the trio to be more civil and submissive
for the future. Whatever the other two
might have thought, the ‘heavy’ was by no means
inclined to make a target of his fat ribs for the sledge-hammer
blows of Julius’s brawny arms; and with a
few remarks upon the folly of quarreling in general,
and of fighting on the present occasion in particular,
not forgetting to remind us of ‘one original stock,’
‘Saxon race,’ etc., the good-natured ‘plunger’ effected
an armistice, which was sealed and ratified
with the remains of the whisky-bottle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After his recent severe experience, it seemed unlikely
that Mr. Coke would soon regret life in the
prairies, with its painful alternations of bitter cold
and parching heat; its frequent privations, hunger,
thirst, fatigue, restive mules, hard labor, and scanty
rest. During a seven weeks’ passage between Fort
Vancouver and the Sandwich Islands, on board the
Mary Dare, a wretched little coal-tub of a brig, he
and his companions actually found themselves vaunting
the superior comforts of their late land-journey.
Confined by constant wet weather to a cabin twelve
feet by eight, without a mattress to lie on, but with
a superabundance of fleas, rats and cockroaches, they
blessed the hour when they first caught sight of the
palm-crowned shores of the Sandwich group. Mr.
Coke’s account of his stay at the Hawaiian court is
lively enough, but of no particular interest; and the
sort of thing has been much better done before by
Herman Melville and others. After the adventurous
journey across the Rocky Mountains, this part
of the book reads but tamely, and we are not sorry
to get Mr. Coke back to North America. He and
Fred landed at San Francisco. A long letter which
he wrote thence, after a month’s stay in the country,
is here reprinted, having originally been inserted in
the <span class='it'>Times</span> newspaper by the friend to whom it was
addressed. He adds some further particulars and
characteristic anecdotes. His account of the diggings,
both wet and dry, but especially of the latter,
fully confirms the mass of evidence already adduced
as to their incalculable richness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The quartz rock,” he says, “which is supposed
to be the only permanent source from which gold
will eventually be derived, extends north and south
for more than a degree and a half of latitude. At
Maripoosa, a society, possessing several ‘claims,’
have established, at a great expense, machinery for
crushing the rock. They employ thirty men, whom
they pay at the rate of 100 dollars each a month.
This society is now making a clear gain of 1500
dollars a-day. This will show you what is to be expected
when capital sets to work in the country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the sketches at <span class='it'>table-d’hôtes</span> and gambling-tables
are extremely natural and spirited. Mr.
Coke and Fred, whilst at San Francisco, lived at El
Dorado, the best hotel there; four meals a-day,
dinner as good as at Astor’s at New York, venison,
grizzly-bear, Sandhill-crane, and other delicacies;
cost of board and lodging eight dollars a-day—not
dear for California. At the dinner-table they made
some queer acquaintances; amongst others a certain
Major M., whose first mark of good-will, after his
introduction to them by a judge, (judges and majors
swarm at San Francisco) was to offer to serve as
their friend in any “difficulty” into which they
might get. The judge suggested that the two English
gentlemen might probably have no need of a
“friend” in that sense of the word. The Major’s
reply will be our last extract.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Sir,’ said the Major, ‘they are men of honor;
and as men of honor, you observe, there is no saying
what scrapes they may get into. I remember—it
can’t be more than twenty years ago—a brother
officer and I were opponents at a game of poker.
That officer and I were most intimately acquainted.
Another bottle of champagne, you nigger, and fill
those gentlemen’s glasses. Very fine that, sir—I
never tasted better wine,’ said the Major, as he
turned his mustaches up, and poured the gooseberry
down. ‘Where was I, Judge? Ah! precisely—most
intimate acquaintance, you observe—I had the
highest opinion of that officer’s honor—the highest
possible opinion,’ with an oath. ‘Well, sir, the luck
was against me—I never won a hand! My partner
couldn’t stand it. ’Gad, sir, he <span class='it'>did</span> swear. But my
friend—another slice of crane, nigger, and rather
rare; come, gentlemen, help yourself, and pass the
bottle—that’s what I call a high old wine, you observe.
Where was I, Judge? Ah! just so.—Well,
my friend, you observe, did not say a word; but took
it as coolly as could be. We kept on losing; they
kept on winning; when, as quick as greased lightning,
what do you think my partner did, sir? May
I be stuck, forked end up, in a ’coon hole, if he didn’t
whip out his knife and chop off three of my friend’s
fingers. My friend, you observe, halloo’d loud
enough. ‘You may halloo,’ says my partner, ‘but
if you’d had a full, sir, you’d have lost your hand,’
(an oath.) My intimate friend, you observe, had
been letting his partner know what cards he had by
putting out a finger for each one; and having the
misfortune, you observe, to hold three when my
partner found him out, why, sir, you observe, he
lost three of his fingers.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between his roguish friend and his ruffianly partner,
the Major felt himself in a dilemma how to
act.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I think,’ said the Judge, ‘I have heard the
story before; but, excuse me, I do not see exactly
what relation it bears to these gentlemen, and your
offer to serve them.’ ‘That,’ said the Major, ‘if
you will give me time, is exactly what I am coming
to.—Nigger, bring me a dozen cigars.—The sequel
is soon told. Considering my duty as an officer, a
friend, and a gentleman, I cut my friend, and shot
my partner for insulting him; and if, you observe,
these gentlemen shall honor me with their friendship,
I will be most happy to do the same by them.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst deprecating the good offices of this Yankee
O’Trigger in the shooting or cutting line, Mr. Coke
and his companion availed of him as a guide to an
adjacent faro table, where the gallant Major lost
eight hundred dollars with infinite coolness, drank a
cocktail, buttoned his coat, and walked away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As matter of mere amusement, Mr. Coke’s last
chapter is his best. It is crammed with diverting
stories of “smart” Yankees and other originals
whom he encountered in California. The whole
book, although in parts a little drawn out, does him
credit, and will doubtless be extensively read and
well liked. For various classes it has features
of attractive interest. The emigrant, the gold-seeker,
the sportsman, the mining speculator, the
lover of adventure for mere adventure’s sake, will
all derive pleasure from its pages, and occasionally
glean from them a hint worth remembering.</p>

<div><h1><a id='pam'></a>THE PAMPAS FIRED BY THE INDIANS.<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The sun had yet scarce tinged the horizon with the
first dawn of light, when, with a body hot and unrefreshed,
I issued from the door of the hacienda of
San Jacinto, to enjoy the cool air of morning, and
soothe my limbs with the clear, pure water of a
rivulet that coursed past the rear of my last night’s
resting-place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All was yet still around—none seemed to be stirring—and
as I glanced over the extensive plains that
extended on one side as far as the eye could reach,
I could only discern by the misty light a herd of
wild horses, as they swept along through the tall,
wiry grass that arose above their shoulders. Buckling
my pistol-belt around me, I threw my short
rifle carelessly across my back, where it hung by its
own strap, and rapidly proceeded to descend the
steep gully, at the bottom of which the stream, one
of the many that descend from the Andes, ran bubbling
and boiling, as it glanced over its rocky bed.
Uneven and stony, with the footing concealed beneath
thick matted grass and small stunted brushwood,
I found my task any thing but an easy one,
and almost regretted that I had not gone round by
the path used by the people of the hacienda. Yet,
as I swung from rock to rock by aid of the rank
herbage, I felt that the course I had chosen was
most in consonance with that wild, reckless spirit
that had conducted me over so many lands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I reached the bed of the gully, the sun showed
itself above the horizon, and the misty haze that filled
the deep valley was riven and dispersed in eddying
vapor before the warm breath of day. The curtain
risen, there lay before me a wide level space of the
finest alluvial soil, over which, it would appear, the
stream at times extended, when swollen with the
melting snows of the Andes; but it was now confined
to narrow limits in the centre, now and then
extending into large water-holes, where the softer
soil had been washed away, or a diverging bend of
the stream had given more power to its waters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scene was calm, happy nature illuminated by
the glow of a tropical sunrise, for it was December,
and the sun had almost attained the tropic of Capricorn.
But my uncomfortable limbs, twitching with
the effects of numberless musqueto bites, would not
permit me to enjoy, for any lengthened time, the
beauties of nature; so, divesting myself of my apparel,
I took my position on a flat rock in the stream,
and plied my person with frequent showers of water
that I cast over myself, by the aid of a large vessel
I had brought from the hacienda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the spot where I stood, the stream nearly approached
the opposite side of the gully to that on
which the buildings were erected, and during a pause
in my occupation, my attention was drawn to a
rustling noise among the low brushwood that lined
the face of the precipitous descent. They were
times of danger and peril; vast numbers of Indians
were known to be scattered over the pampas, and so
daring had they become, by a large accession of numbers
from the tribes of the lower Sanquel river, that
they had even taken and plundered several villages
along the foot of the mountains, in the direction of
the route to Paraguay. Accustomed to caution,
therefore, the rustling sound was not passed unnoticed,
but with a keen glance I scanned the direction
whence the sound had proceeded; but naught told
of the existence of any living thing, much less
danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again, therefore, I sought the comforts afforded
by the cool water being thrown over my limbs, for I
was afraid to trust myself into deep water, on account
of the many venomous reptiles that usually
infest the South American streams. Suddenly a cry
of alarm startled me; I slipped from the stone on
which I stood, and fell at full length into deep water
beside me. As I fell, I felt a sharp twinge on my
left thigh, and by the color of the water became
aware that I was wounded. It was all the work of
a moment, quick as thought; and when I turned my
eyes to the spot whence I had first heard the rustling
noise, there stood, in the very act of having discharged
an arrow, and with bow yet elevated, an
Indian warrior, with his war-lock ornamented with
a few bright feathers, and his dark body entirely
divested of clothing, with the exception of a deep
fringed leathern belt, fastened round the loins, and
descending mid thigh. Before he had time to draw
another arrow from his quiver, and fit it to the bow.
I sprang from the stream on the bank, seized my
rifle, poised it, and fell on one knee close under a rock,
which protected me from the aim of my enemy, and
at the same time afforded full opportunity to try the
effect of my rifle on his warlike form. But rapidly
as he had appeared and attempted my life, he disappeared
yet more quickly; he seemed to have sunk
into the very rocks on which he had been standing;
but my knowledge of the Indians made me well
aware he had only concealed himself under the thick
brushwood, which, although it would afford him
shelter when in a crouching posture, yet would be
no screen to him if attempting to leave the spot.
So, reserving my fire, I merely covered the spot with
my rifle, where I knew him to be, calmly awaiting
the first good opportunity to try my aim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the furthest I could not be sixty yards from my
enemy; the cry I had heard, and which had saved
my life, proceeded from one of the rancheros, who
had arisen, disturbed by my leaving the building, and
followed to the edge of the gully to demand some
orders of me. Not wishing to risk his neck in the
descent, and considering the path too far round, he
had composedly stretched himself on the edge of the
precipice to await my return, amusing himself in the
meanwhile by observing my motions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst so doing, his eye had chanced to alight
upon the Indian, who had been concealed previously,
in the act of discharging the arrow. The alarm had
disturbed his aim and saved my life, the wound being
only a slight flesh one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shout of the ranchero had aroused all within
the buildings of the hacienda, and the face of the
precipice was now crowded with numbers hurrying
down to my assistance as they best could;
among the foremost were my own companions of
travel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Each moment rendered the position of the Indian
more critical; for on the arrival in the flat of the
many that were now rushing down its sides, he
would be exposed to a fire from which he would
have but little chance of escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the instinct of his race, the warrior of the
pampas seemed fully aware of his danger, for, before
any had reached half-way to where I lay, his dark
body sprang from the cover that protected him, and
with rapid bounds he sought to reach the summit of
the gully. A fierce and prolonged yell told of his
attempt, and several shots were fired, but ineffectually,
on account of distance. I alone was within
good shot; covered with the rifle, whose aim had
been so often proved, I felt his life was in my hands;
for a moment I hesitated—but the nature of my position
overpowered all thoughts of mercy—the mouth
of my piece poured forth its small sheet of flame, and
before the sharp report had ceased to reverberate,
the body of my enemy was tumbling, a lifeless mass,
from rock to rock, forcing its way through the tangled,
matted grass and brush-wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Congratulating friends, and startled tenants of the
hacienda soon surrounded me, and the body of the
Indian being dragged to the bank of the stream, two
friendly Indians of the party pronounced it to be that
of a powerful chief of one of the southern tribes, who
were said to be committing the depredations in the
villages under the Andes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What brought the chief away from his tribe, and
in the neighborhood of the hacienda, remained unexplained,
until some of the guides who had been
dispatched at the first alarm, to bring in the few
horses that remained unturned out the previous
night, joined the party, and informed us that they had
seen three other Indians issue from the gully, some
short distance down, and, mounting horses that had
been in charge of two companions, dash across the
plain with a led horse, in the direction of the mountains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This news caused no inconsiderable stir amongst
the motley assemblage, and we returned to the hacienda
to decide what course we were to adopt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten days previous, with three companions, all
Englishmen, three guides, and four rancheros as attendants,
we left St. Jago with the intention of proceeding
by land to Buenos Ayres. The reason of
our employing the rancheros was, that they had a
short time previous accompanied a Valparaiso merchant
from St. Fé to St. Jago, and had been most
useful to him on the route. Absent from their own
country they were glad of an opportunity to return,
and we secured them for a comparatively small recompense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guides were the usual adjuncts to all travelers,
and indispensable in order to pilot us on our way,
and catch horses for us, when those we rode were
knocked up. The previous evening we had arrived
at the hacienda of San Jacinto, after having two days
before descended from the Andes, whence it was
distant some ninety miles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A kind of station-house was here for the guides,
where they changed: those who had conducted us
across the precipices and defiles of those eternal
snow-clad mountains, giving place to others who
were to conduct us to the settled districts of the
Buenos Ayrean plains, where their services would
be no longer required. It was also used as a place
of refreshment, where the usual Pampa fare was to
be obtained, with some most execrable peach brandy,
and a little bad wine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several other houses stood in the neighborhood of
the hacienda, inhabited by cross-bred herdsmen,
almost as wild as the stock they were in charge of,
and a few women their companions in the wilderness,
and an odd child was also visible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several other travelers had arrived the same evening
as ourselves, but none traveling in our direction,
and no European. Having consulted, and the majority
being of opinion that the Indians who had
alarmed us were merely a scouting party at some
distance from their tribe, it was resolved that all
should proceed on their journey. Against this almost
unanimous decision, one of our companions, a mercantile
man from St. Jago, rebelled, and chose rather
to return in company with the chief body of travelers,
who were proceeding across the Andes, than
face the danger of meeting the hostile Indians with
our small force. Remonstrance to change his resolve
was of no avail, so, as soon as fresh horses had been
obtained, with my two companions and attendants I
pursued my way, leaving all around the hacienda in
anxious preparation to receive any attack that might
be made on them by the Indians in revenge for the
death of one of their chiefs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the suggestion of the guides we refrained
from at once striking across the plains the way our
road lay, in order to deceive any one who might
follow, and descending into the bed of the gully by
the path, followed its course some fifteen miles before
we ascended to the level plains, and struck into
the Pampas across which our journey was to be performed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When once on level soil we urged our horses to
their utmost speed, and when two hours before sun
set we halted to refresh ourselves, it was considered
that a space of at least sixty miles divided us from
the scene of the morning adventure. Around naught
could be seen but the undulating bosom of the Pampas,
as the tall, wiry grass that covered its face,
bent beneath a slight breeze that fanned our heated
temples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guides soon cleared a large circular space, for
our night’s resting-place, of the parched grass, and a
fire being kindled, a cup of coffee, with some dried
beef and a few biscuits, revived our wearied
frames.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In consequence of the circumstances of the morning,
all the horses were retained and made fast to
pegs taken from the Spanish saddles of our guides,
who carried them for such emergencies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our course had lain eastward all day, and the sun
was fast sinking to the western horizon, whence we
had come, when an exclamation from one of the
rancheros, who had risen to see to the perfect security
of the horses, drew our attention to a point
whither he directed our view, by a motion of the
arm. Long and intense was the gaze, but our European
eyes could discover nothing, till a telescope
was obtained from the traveling case of one of my
friends, which soon satisfied us that a large body of
horsemen were advancing rapidly along the very
track we had come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a moment of deep anxiety—what was to be
done? Were we to wait and take the chance of its
being a friendly tribe of Indians or travelers? We
could not have a chance of escape on the jaded
horses we had so hardly tasked during the day, so,
from inevitable necessity, we determined, friend or,
foe, to await them where we were. Rapid were the
preparations made to fight, in case they proved to be
enemies. The horses were saddled, some spare arms
furnished to the guides, and rifles and pistols being
looked to, each man beside his horse, and drawn up
in line, we awaited the result. Nearer and nearer
they approached; the lower edge of the sun had dipped
beneath the horizon, and anxiously we prayed
for darkness, when the guides pronounced the advancing
party to be strange Indians. Still clear light
remained, and onward yet they came. Their very
number was appalling; sixty at least were in view,
and as they bent forward over their horses, and
urged them on, the wild gestures of their arms
seemed to announce our doom, and to forewarn us
that our bones would bleach on the wild Pampas of
Central America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was no time, however, for reflection. Their
yells sounded in our ears, and they advanced in a
dense body within two hundred paces of the position
we had taken. Then came a halt, and out from the
main body rode a single Indian. The savage strode
his horse without saddle or any other appurtenance
than a raw hide strap, formed into a bridle, with
which he managed his steed. His arms consisted
of a bow and arrows, slung across his back, with a
long hunting-knife and heavy tomahawk suspended
from his belt; his followers were mounted and
armed like their chief, none possessing fire-arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly he rode forward some hundred yards nearer
than his people, till he paused in a position where
the rifle of any of the party could have ended his
days. But we were in no position to commence
hostilities, so we wisely refrained from such a useless
sacrifice of life. We still had a hope that the
tribe in whose presence we were, formed no part of
that whose chief fell in the morning; and, in order
to ascertain the fact, one of the guides addressed the
chief in a <span class='it'>patois</span> of the Indian tongue, but—although
the attempt was renewed by the two others, it
called forth no response. He still continued calmly
gazing at us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, as if actuated by a passing thought, he
wheeled his horse round, and joined his followers.
Then, indeed, his voice was heard, clear and distinct,
and, from his commanding gestures, it was
apparent that he exercised supreme sway over the
assembled warriors. At his word the crowd dissolved,
and keeping without the range of our rifles,
they formed a circle around us. It was no time for
indecision; so, mounting our horses, we formed a
double line, back to back, each man with his rifle
or pistols ready. Then, indeed, imagination alone
can depict the fierce war-cries that issued from all
around us, the rush of horses, and the cloud of arrows
that threatened annihilation to all. One of my
English companions fell from his horse at the first
discharge. We returned the fire with some effect,
and, as a last hope, each for himself, dashed fearlessly
on the line as they closed upon us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Darkness was just setting in, so our hope was to
escape singly, and make the best of our way back to
the hacienda, if successful. The rush was fearful.
The bright knives of two enemies, on whom I
dashed, glared in my eyes; but fire-arms again
proved their superiority: one fell, and the stroke of
the other but wounded my horse. Maddened with
the pain of the wound it had received, the noble
horse I rode plunged forward, and, at a tremendous
speed, swept me in a moment beyond reach of a few
stray arrows aimed at me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, yet still, I had a chance for my life. I thought
of my companions, but darkness hid every thing,
beyond the space of a few yards, from my view.
On, on I dashed, plunging the long spurs, with which
my heels were armed, into the side of my willing
steed. I could perceive, by the voices behind, that
many were in pursuit, and after a mile or so had
been passed over, I clearly discerned the voices
gaining on me, and from an occasional stagger of my
horse, ascertained, but too truly, that loss of blood
was making him faint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time it was completely dark, day having
passed away with usual tropical rapidity, and my
resolve was made. Throwing myself on my feet, I
struck the noble brute that so far had saved me, and
abandoned him to his own head. Relieved of my
weight, I depended on his keeping on some distance
before he could be overtaken by my pursuers. At
the same time, placing myself on my face, I trusted
to being passed over undiscovered—concealed, as I
was, by the long grass. A minute had but elapsed,
when at least a score of horsemen rushed past, on
either side of me, inflicting no injury, but evidently
urging, in the pursuit, their comrades by voice and
gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When their voices could no longer be heard, I
arose from my reclining posture, and struck off at
an angle from the course they had gone. I toiled,
with difficulty, through the long pampa-grass, encumbered
as I was, and had not proceeded more
than a couple of miles, when voices again drew
near, and I had to conceal myself as before. Once
more they passed, but at some distance; and I then
concluded they had overtaken my horse, and discovered
the escape of its rider. This nerved me to
further exertion, as I felt satisfied the strictest search
would be made, particularly as I was known to be
an Englishman—and in those wild regions that name
is almost universally connected with wealth—so
that, for the sake of plunder alone, no exertion was
likely to be spared to effect my capture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Onward, therefore, I forced my way, pushing
aside the rank, dry herbage, and, attracted by a sudden
bright glare, casting my eyes behind, the appalling
fact was at once apparent, that the pampas had
been fired by the Indians, for the purpose of destroying
myself and any others that might have escaped
the first onslaught.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To such a number of men as the attacking party
consisted of, the firing of the long, dry grass would
offer but little danger; for, before so doing, it is the
habit of the Indians to clear a large space of the
herbage, and every thing that would afford fuel for
the flame, in the centre of this a safe retreat could
be found until the fire had exhausted itself on all
around, leaving nothing but the naked blackened
plains. For a single individual there seemed no
hope that I could clear by unaided exertions, any
such space as would afford a hope of safety; so, in
despair, still onward I recklessly rushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night was still and calm; but there the fire
was to be seen, extending with fearful rapidity, as
the expansion of the air by heat, swept its sparks
over the surrounding grass, dry as tinder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All hope seemed fled. I was apparently doomed
to die a fearful death by fire, when, by the aid of the
light yielded by the vast blaze, yet distant some
miles, I discerned the carcass of the gallant horse
who had so lately borne me from amongst my enemies.
Further it was useless to fly; the relentless
element would soon overtake me; so I determined
to make here one more effort for my life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The animal was dead, and it required but one look
to assure me that he bore many marks of tomahawk
wounds, inflicted by the Indians in their first moment
of disappointment. Beside the body, also, lay
a heavy weapon of that kind, and on seeing it, my
mode of proceeding, to effect my safety, was resolved
on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a case-knife I always carried about me, I
cut or tore away the herbage and grass for a short
distance round the body; but my utmost exertion
enabled me only to do this to the extent of a few
feet, when the nearer approach of the fire warned
me to other things. So small, indeed, was the space
thus cleared, that I felt satisfied it would be impossible
to exist, without other shelter, when the fire
surrounded me. That protection the carcass offered;
so, seizing the tomahawk, I rapidly ripped up
the body with that and my knife, and tore from the
inner part the yet warm entrails.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The few minutes so occupied had brought the
fire within a few hundred yards, and, as I crushed
myself within the reeking carcass, and covered my
exposed limbs with masses of the disgusting offal, I
could scarce turn my fascinated sight from the appalling
scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As far as the eye could extend, on either side,
nought was to be distinguished but one bright mass
of flame—some twenty feet high—above which
hung, in dense clouds, dark black smoke; while, yet
higher still, light white vapor floated and rose into
the heavens. Around, all was as bright as day, and
the long, wiry grass could be even discerned bending
before the fearful element, as it advanced to annihilate.
No breeze swept over the plains; but yet
the fire roared and raged, as if hurled along before
the breath of a hurricane. The fleeting instants of
suspense that elapsed before the fire reached the spot
where I lay, looked almost like long hours. My fate
hung in the balance, and uncertainty was worse than
death. Years have since passed away, but when
lying on my calm and quiet bed, I yet start with
alarm: the shadows of the past flit over my memory,
and I fancy myself yet awaiting the moment that
would enclose me in that fearful flaming sea. The
agony of suspense was passed; fire was around, beside,
within me, as I swallowed the hot, furnace
breath of the atmosphere. Oh, God! my very vitals
were dried up, and my brain seemed ready to burst,
as my swollen blood-vessels distended to the utmost.
Oh, thus to perish!—in the spring of life: friends,
home, early days, for an instant crossed my mind
Oh! but to die by fire!—frightful, fearful!—“Oh,
great God, save me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The struggle seemed over; although the fire could
not reach my body, covered as it was, yet the intense
heat seemed to destroy life, and for a time
rendered me insensible. When consciousness returned,
the fire was little more than visible on the
horizon, and the cold and clammy flesh and entrails
pressed upon my burning, parched limbs. A violent
thirst actuated me, and in order to allay it, I was
reduced to the necessity of cutting a large mass of
flesh from the buttock, and sucking the blood and
moisture therefrom; till then I could scarce breathe;
the heated air I had swallowed so parched and dried
up my mouth and throat, that the thick skin peeled
off when touched by my tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Revived by my application, once more my
thoughts reverted to my position, and the chance of escape.
It was improbable that the Indians would make
any search over the plains till daylight made such
comparatively easy, and up to morning I calculated
on safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the locality I knew but very little, merely
what had been learned from the guides; but of one
thing I felt satisfied, that I should be sure to be captured
if I attempted to return in the direction of San
Jacinto. The guides had stated that for some distance
to the southward, many deep gullies, with
streams in their beds, ran out for a great distance in
the Pampas, many of them in a straight line from
the Andes, at the foot of which they commenced.
This determined me to strike off in a southerly direction,
guided by the stars, and endeavor to reach
one of these before daylight would leave any stray
Indian to discover me with little difficulty on the
blackened, naked plains, where not even a rock for
concealment existed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when I attempted to walk, I found I could do
so with great exertion only; yet it was the last
chance, so, abandoning my rifle and all other things
of any weight, except my pistols, and a small junk
of horse-flesh, I tottered along as I best could. Hour
after hour I struggled on; morning came, yet nothing
was to be seen but one black, scorched surface, as far
as the eye could reach. Not a living thing was in
sight, not even the hum of an insect enlivened the
atmosphere; all was drear and desolate. Anxiously,
from time to time, I glanced around the
horizon, but friend and enemy seemed alike absent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun had risen into the heavens, three hours
had elapsed since daylight, when my sight was
cheered by the distant view of a few shrubs and verdure,
which, on a nearer approach, I found to be
growing along the far side of a steep, narrow gully,
at the bottom of which, as usual, ran a stream. The
fire had burned up all on one side, but the water had
effectually stopped its progress to the other, so here
at last was a good cover afforded me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wants of nature were first allayed—I drank
long and heartily, and, careless of all reptiles, actually
rolled myself, clothes and all, in the bed of
the stream. Hunger I did not feel, thirst alone had
afflicted me, and in the course of my night’s journey
I had sucked the piece of horse flesh till it was as
dry as my scorched boots themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No time was lost, when I had revived myself, in
following up the course of the creek, now and again
ascending to the edge of the plains, to ascertain if
pursuers were in sight; but I traveled on, mile after
mile, without seeing the glimpse of any living thing
on the side whence I had a right to look for the Indians.
All that side of the creek or gully bore evident
marks of the late conflagration, which in no
part extended to the side I was now on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was quite uncertain whither I was proceeding;
I only felt satisfied that in some days I should reach
the neighborhood of the Andes, by pursuing the
course I had taken, and there I hoped to find some
village or hacienda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As day declined, however, I felt the calls of nature,
and hunger made powerful demands upon me;
but I had nothing wherewith to satisfy it. Throughout
the day there had not appeared either horses or
wild cattle, from which it was to be inferred that
they had been driven far from the banks of the creek
by the appearance of the fire on one side; so that thus
the small chance of being able to surprise and bring
down a wild calf, with my pistols, was taken away
for the present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet although at least thirty miles of ground were
traversed from daylight to sunset, I partook of no
nourishment but the cool water beside which I was
traveling, and at night, overcome with fatigue, made
my bed with some grass I had pulled, beneath an
overhanging rock, without tasting food for twenty-four
hours, notwithstanding my extreme fatigue
during that period.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long and soundly did I sleep, but the damp, cold
air of morning chilled me, and disturbed those slumbers
an hour or so before daylight, when, in order to
infuse warmth into my limbs, and make some progress
on my way, I pursued my path along the bed
of the creek, without waiting for the rays of the sun
to direct my steps. Again for weary hours, under
a burning sun, I struggled on, till about mid-day
nature became exhausted from sheer want of food,
and I sunk, unable to proceed farther, at the side of
the stream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Starvation stared me in the face, and threatened
my existence, with the same certainty the fire had
appeared to do such a short time before; neither
birds nor beasts showed themselves; roots there
were none to be found, and again despair overshadowed
my soul, when I observed a large water-snake
issue from the stream, and leisurely trail its
dark body along toward the crevices of some rocks
near at hand. It was the work of a moment to hurl
a large stone at it, which broke its spine, and a stroke
of a knife finished the matter. I then deprived the
animal of its head, in which I was aware any poison
it possessed was contained, and collecting a few
pieces of dry kindling, of which plenty was scattered
along the plain, a fire was soon kindled, and the body
of the Pampa snake being broiled, afforded refreshment
to the exhausted traveler, such as he never had
obtained from the primest eels of fatherland; intense
hunger made the food, disgusting at other times, more
than palatable on that occasion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Invigorated by this food, after a short rest I pushed
forward, taking with me the remains of the snake,
all of which I had cooked in order to prevent the
necessity of kindling a fire, the smoke of which
might attract the attention of the Indians, if in my
vicinity. My caution still continued, and in most
convenient spots where the ascent was easy, I still
continued to seek the edge of the prairie, and carefully
scan its surface. It was during one of these
reconnaisances that I first caught sight of a scattered
party of Indians, advancing at full speed along the
plains, on the other side of the gully, close by its
edge. Fortunately I was near to a buffalo track that
had been formed by these animals to the water, and
along this I crept on all fours, till I had gained some
high thick grass, where I stretched myself in complete
concealment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether the Indians were a portion of the party
who had attacked us I was not aware, but they
seemed to take but a cursory view of the creek as
they passed rapidly along; they did not at all descend
to its bed; so I was in no danger of having my trail discovered.
I could hear the tramp of the horses as they
swept along over the blackened, parched ground;
but I did not dare attempt to get a near view of
them, lest their keen vision should detect my lurking-place.
When they had some time passed, cautiously
I arose, and scanned the horizon, to discover if any
straggling child of the wilderness was yet in view;
but it appeared the wearied traveler was alone in the
scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My journey was renewed, but this time along the
edge of the plain, as I feared lest the Indians might
suddenly come up when I should not perceive their
approach from the bed of the creek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another night, another day was passed, during
which my only food was the remains of the snake
I had grilled. The gully gradually increased in
width, and a diverging branch of it, on the northern
side, had intercepted the progress of the fire in that
direction; so again, on both sides of the gully,
nothing was to be discerned but the long waving
grass of the plains, with, as I left the scene of the
conflagration behind, occasional herds of wild cattle,
and horses, which frequently allowed a near approach
before they fled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the fourth day I succeeded in surprising and
shooting a young buffalo, which, with many others,
was standing in the water of the stream, to endeavor
to preserve themselves from the myriads of flies
and musquetoes that filled the air, and inflicted their
stings without cessation. Although brought down
by the first shot, yet I saw considerable danger from
the remainder of the herd, who charged me, and I
only saved myself by taking refuge on the summit
of some steep rocks, in the side of the cliffs, which
the enraged animals could not reach. A second shot
dispersed the herd, and they fled up the side of the
gully and across the plains till out of sight; whilst
some thin steaks, cut from the flank of the prize I had
obtained, fully rewarded success. When broiled and
washed down with pure clear water, they satisfied
appetite, and strengthened my frame for further
exertion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking some beef with me, I pursued my weary
journey, yet my spirits did not fail; although at
times my weary limbs flagged, hope was mine, and
that buoyancy of feeling, and presence of mind,
which had conducted me through so many trying
scenes, never forsook me on this occasion for a
moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the morning of the eighth day, I had reached
a position close under one of the spurs of the Andes,
and was following up a track that I had fallen across,
and which I imagined might lead to some village,
when my ears were saluted with the pleasing sound
of mule bells.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyous, indeed, were then my thoughts, and when
in a few minutes I joined a party of muleteers, conveying
hides and tallow to the small town of San
Julianna, my thanks were many and fervent to that
Supreme Being who had preserved me through many
dangers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having a few specie dollars about me, I procured
every assistance from the party I had so providentially
fallen in with, and afterward journeyed on to
the town whither they were bound. Here, having
obtained what ready money I required on one of my
St. Jago letters of credit, I procured assistance, and
set forward to the hacienda, where all my troubles
had commenced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the way, at another hacienda, I fell in with
two of the rancheros, both suffering from severe
wounds received in our action with the Indians, but
who nevertheless had escaped by the speed of their
horses, and the neglect of all pursuit beyond a short
distance, by the Indians, who seemed to have turned
all their exertions toward securing the Europeans
of the party. The other two rancheros, the guides,
and my two companions, had not been heard of, and
were supposed, as I myself had been, to have been
killed in the attack, or to have perished in the
flames.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A subsequent visit to the spot, and the calcined
remains of seven bodies, satisfied me that my friends
were no more; the Indians who had fallen seemed
to have been removed, and all that now points out
the scene of that bloody deed, is the raised mound
that covers those of our party who there fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the year 18—, just as the U. S. frigate Constitution
was about leaving Leghorn on a cruise, a
large Italian ship arrived from Genoa, stripped of
every thing valuable by a piratical schooner in the
Gulf of Spezzia. Two English men-of-war and a
Frenchman were lying in port at the time, and obtaining
all the information they could from the master
and crew of the plundered vessel, all four set sail
on the same day in search of the daring marauder.
Her usual fortune, however, attended the American
frigate, for, on the morning of the fourth day after
leaving port, she fell in with the fellow off the
northern point of the Island of Sardinia; and after a
long chase—in which the schooner was considerably
cut up, the wind dying away to a calm—her capture
was at last effected by the boats. After removing
the remainder of her crew, a breeze sprung up at
daylight, and the Constitution and her prize made all
sail for the bay of Naples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evening after we passed the Straits of Bonifacio,
a difficulty occurred between two of the elder
midshipmen, which, but for the timely interference
of an old master’s mate, a great favorite in the ship,
would have inevitably resulted in an exchange of
shots on the first convenient occasion. The parties
were bosom friends and near relatives, which, of
course, made the matter more difficult to adjust;
however, the mate was able to effect it, as, from
some circumstances attending his own history, he
had more influence with them both than any other
man on board. In some untoward affair, long before
he entered the service, he himself had killed his
man, and although he never spoke of the encounter,
it was believed by the mess that he bitterly regretted
its occurrence. He had been unusually grave and
quiet after the capture of the schooner, which was
more noticed, for the reason that, in general, he was
as ready-witted, frank-spoken a fellow as ever felt
salt spray on his cheek. The truth was, he was one
of that unfortunate class of seamen who, well-connected
and educated with care, have, nevertheless,
spent the best of their days alternately in ship’s forecastles
and drinking-shops, after having run upon
some rock or other in their youth. It is a matter of
notoriety that there are too many such men to be
found afloat, but the peculiarity in Miller’s case was,
that at some period of his wild life he must have
mustered resolution enough to overcome his passion
for strong drink. To have seen him on the decks of
the frigate, or at the mess, you would never have
suspected that he had once sunk so low in the scale
of creation, had you not been better informed by that
sort of malice which is ever ready to hiss on the
track of an altered man. As it was, I may mention
that he had entered the navy through the hawse-hole
and worked his way up to a master’s mate’s berth,
where, of course—according to the rigid rules of the
service—he stuck. Great confidence was reposed
in him by the quarter-deck, and not one of the mids
but would have shared the last dollar of his pay, or
fought to the last gasp for old Harry, if he had ever
needed a friend at a pinch. His fine, off-hand way,
and thorough seamanship, made him a great favorite
with the men, as was once rather awkwardly shown
when some trouble occurred in another frigate, on a
former cruise. In fact, there was a degree of kindliness
about the man, which, combined with his good
looks and weatherly qualities, was well calculated
to make him a general favorite—to say nothing of a
tinge of romance which, it seemed, neither Neptune
nor Bacchus could entirely wash out of him. No
officer in the ship had the same dashing way of laying
a boat along-side in a rough sea, or was better
qualified to take charge of the deck on a sudden
emergency; and although you might have heard nothing
of him before this cruise, you soon felt compelled
to yield the palm of seamanship to him, when
you once caught his quick, unembarrassed glance, or
heard his deep voice answering the quarter-deck on
a dark night, in a squall, with a clear ring in its pitch,
which the men used to say was worth a dozen trumpets.
With all this, you felt that he ought to have
been something more than a mere master’s mate,
never doubting by his ways that he had commanded
crafts of some sort in his time. The truth was, that
he had abused or slighted his opportunities; though
having been well brought up, not all the wear and
tear of a hard life in every part of the globe, together
with the slough which he had waded through, could
prevent the thing from shining out. Apart from his
seamanship—of that class which embraced all varieties
of crafts and services—he possessed a knowledge
of books, and a strength of imagination, which made
you wonder still more at the subordinate post
he held in the ship. As Guy Willful, one of our
mess, afterward expressed himself—“though we all
knew Harry Miller to be a gentleman, it was not
until that blessed night when I knocked little Dick
Afterblock into the lee-scuppers, that we found out
the pinch of diamond-dust in the mate’s composition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the evening in question, after seeing the two
friends shake hands, the party had seated themselves
quietly round the mate, who had offered to spin a
yarn that should last out the watch, when a voice
from the forecastle sung out, that there was a large
whale close aboard of the ship. Sure enough, there
he was, close under the main chains, sending up a
succession of regular old-fashioned spouts, for all the
world, the true originals of those which every reflective
reader will remember to have once viewed
with wonder and awe among the prints of his
spelling-book. These were attended by loud respiratory
sounds, which were heard fore and aft the
deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Ironsides was jogging along before a lazy
wind, which barely kept the sails asleep; and the
whale, after again expelling the vitiated air from his
blow-holes, having nothing more attractive to engage
his attention at the time, from a feeling of fellowship
perhaps, kept way with the ship. Some old heads
on the forecastle soon hailed him for “a finner,”
bound on his travels to the Ionian sea, and forthwith
predicted, at the peril of their eyes, that we should
see him “down flukes” and off on a wind, before
another bell had gone. There was little sea running
at the time, and the moon shining fairly on his track
gave us some idea of his gigantic proportions, which,
to tell the truth, these same veritable Tritons were
in nowise disposed to curtail. However, it was
agreed among the mids, debating the matter in council
with the mate, that from his broad flukes to the
small triangular fin on the ridge of his back, and
thence, from his spout-holes to the arch of his lower
jaw, he ran not less than an hundred feet. It was
also estimated that he would outweigh a drove of,
at least, two hundred fat oxen. His age, they
unanimously declared, was a question to be left to
the learned professors. Even the bearded Nestors
of the forecastle, wise as mermen in aught appertaining
to the sea—albeit they claimed him for an
old acquaintance—did not pretend to settle that
point. He might have been fourscore-and-ten, or
he might have blown brine from his nostrils, coasting
undiscovered shores, long before the grand cruise
of Columbus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Willful, the reefer before referred to, took
occasion to indulge in a lofty flight of fancy, as he
announced his adherence to the opinion which measured
the creature’s days by the scale of centuries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I,” squeaked another, fresh from school,
“whatever anguish of spirit it may cost me—‘sink
or swim’—I avow myself of the same faith with the
honorable gentleman whose eloquence has electrified
the ears of these venerable sheet-anchor-men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” said Dick Afterblock, reseating himself
on the spars, “keep a small helm, you featherheads,
and let’s hear Mr. Miller’s yarn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The master’s mate was standing in the moonlight,
seeming to watch the freakish light, as it danced far
away in the whale’s smooth wake, or wandered
among the barnacles on its rough noddle—or peered
dubiously into the wide curvature of its nostrils—or
showed the living eye on the crest of the weltering
wave, twenty feet from where you looked to find it—or
rode triumphantly on its flukes, or upon the
ridge of its back-fin. You might have seen, then,
by the stern, abstracted look of the man’s face, that
his mind was busy with something, which you felt
it was like groping in the dark to attempt to fathom.
Then, as the midshipman spoke, the old weatherly
look came back, slowly though, as if it cost him a
struggle; and after a thoughtful turn or two on the
deck, reseating himself upon the spars, he commenced—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was once, gentlemen,” he said, “cruising near
Cape Musseldon, in command of an armed grab, in
the service of the Sultan of Muscat, when, one
squally morning, in a part of the Persian Gulf where
the navigation is particularly intricate, we fell in
with a large whale-ship, showing American colors.
When we first made her out she had one boat down,
waiting, apparently, for the whales to come up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those seas were then famous feeding-grounds
for the white whale, and although we felt sure there
was a shoal close by, some wonder was expressed in
the grab, at the boldness of the Yankee skipper, in
sending his men off in the face of the fresh squall
then rising over the land. However, as we neared
her the shoal rose, and they fastened. We could
see him lower another boat, which pulled to leeward
of the ship, when the squall struck the grab, and we
lost sight of them all at once. The weather continued
rough for several days, with fog and rain, and
although I felt great anxiety for the safety of the
ship and her boats, as we were almost embayed by
banks and shoals, I heard nothing of their fate, until
sometime after my arrival at Muscat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here the mate paused and walked to the rail to
take another look at the finner, still close aboard,
heading with the proud old frigate, and blowing
away, from time to time, or lifting his sharp back
half out, as if he had a notion to speak us. You
could see the white spray, mingled with condensed
air and mucus from his seething nostrils, rising, in
two divergent branches, straight up from the shifting
gleam of the soft swells, into the clear moonlight,
from whence it faded, before you could wink an eyelid,
into the greenish mass of foam to leeward of his
track, between him and the ship. Two bells struck
a moment after, and as the clang died away in the
lee rigging, and your ear caught again the natural
sounds of the craft, making her way through the
water, the mate returned to his place and resumed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was so thoroughly disgusted with the illiberal
manner in which the British officers had acted in a late
expedition against the pirates of the Gulf, and with
the servility of Syed Seeyd bin Sultan, himself, to
the agents of the East India Company, that I resigned
my commission in his service when the cruise was
up, and had already taken passage in a merchant
dow, for Zanzibar, when the very whaleman I had
seen in the Gulf, came into the cove of Muscat to
recruit, and changed my plans in an unexpected
way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had been on the water that morning, in company
with an Arab chief of high rank, following in
the wake of Muscat Tom, a large finback, which
haunted the harbor, coming in regularly at sunrise,
and making an offing at night, for fear that the current,
which sets in shore at certain seasons, might
catch him asleep. He was as tame as a bull of the
pastures, and we used to arouse ourselves watching
the fishermen paddling after him, to pick up the fish
which he killed, as he drove through shoal after
shoal—his mouth gaping like the after-hatchway,
and the pouch under his jaw as full as a herring-net.
Had he lived in the old days, they had certainly set
up his shrine and paid adoration to him, as he scared
away the sharks from the harbor, and did no mischief,
beyond the playful capsizing of a boat when it
pressed somewhat too closely on his track. There
is no doubt, gentlemen, that the ancients would have
made a very respectable sea-god of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was rather a curious sight to see him lying at
rest in the cove, spouting the brine in air, with the
sun blazing on his back, while his gray pellucid eye
moved sluggishly after you, as your boat shot past
the angle of his jaws; or, stranger still, to watch him
scooping up the affrighted fish in his bone-net, while
the brine poured off of his enormous lips in two
seething streams; and once and awhile, if you
managed the thing right, you might catch a glimpse
of his immense tongue, behind the long hairy slabs
of bone, licking his prey down by the scores. It
made me feel rather antediluvianish, at times, I
confess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“However, as soon as we made out the starred
flag at half-mast, in the offing, we left Tom to follow
his game, and Halil, spreading out his turban to catch
the breeze, while I plied the oars, we were speedily
under her counter—a huge, lumbering ship of eight
hundred tons, with six boats at the cranes, and ten
short twelves mounted on a side, as a defence against
the Toassemes. She was very deep, being full of
sperm oil to the grindstone-tub; and although she
was, as I hinted before, all in a lump, yet as her
skipper had knocked his lubberly tryworks to pieces,
set up his rigging, and crossed his lighter spars, besides
giving her a fresh lick of tar and paint, she
looked, as the Scotch quarter-master said of the fellow
we fell in with off the Western Isles, ‘just no
that bad, for a tallow-strainer.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I offered my services to pilot her in to a berth,
and we were civilly received by her skipper, who,
to tell the truth, was not exactly the man I expected
to find on the weather side of her quarter-deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must figure to yourselves, gentlemen, a
long-sparred, well-built, Spanish-looking personage,
dressed in a blue frock-coat, and spotless drilling
pantaloons, and a sombrero as big round as the capstan-head,
shading his dark face—the strip of crape
round his hat fixing your eye at once, in connection
with the ensign at half-mast, until you found that,
besides losing a boat’s crew on the day we saw her
in the Gulf, his wife, who had made the voyage
with him, had slipped over the stern one night in a
calm, and been drowned, in spite of every effort to
save her. The man’s features, though somewhat
roughened by continual exposure, and blackened by
the sun, were as regular as if cut out of stone by some
master hand, from the broad brow and aquiline nose,
to the square jaw and finely modelled chin, fringed
by a beard as glossy and wavy as our first captain’s
of the maintop. Every thing about him contrasted
oddly enough with his ragged and slovenly crew,
and the patched and greasy canvas over his head,
until you would almost have sworn, from his mustache,
the eye-glass at his button-hole, and the narrow
strip of black ribbon, which fell across the
snowy mouth of his watch-fob, that he was some
whimsical Monsieur on his travels in the East.
There was a courteous ease in his address, and a
silver twang in his voice, which indicated, rather
unpleasantly, that in spite of the bit of crape and the
mourning flag, Captain Catherton had banished black
care from his end of the ship. Somehow or other,
I felt, after the first ten minutes’ interview, that
there was a lurking devil behind his smile, sweet as
it was, and, with all his civil chaff, it was precious
little he would have done to serve me in my wish to
reach home, had he not chanced to want a mate to
suit his purposes, in place of the man that was lost
in the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As soon as he discovered that I had commanded
the grab, he at once pressed me to take the chief
officer’s berth, remarking of the other five, that he
would hardly trust them in charge of the deck, with
the cargo he had under hatches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To tell the truth, I was glad of the chance at the
time; for, besides that the place was too hot for a
Ghebir—the thermometer standing at midnight
at 110° on the forecastle of the grab, then lying off
the mouth of the passage between Muscat Island and
the main land—I was anxious to leave the coast
before a conspiracy, which I knew was forming to
dethrone the Sultan, should explode. The cholera,
too, was sweeping off the Arabs like flies, and in the
very thick of it I had my life twice attempted on
shore, for naught that I could conjecture, except that
I had peremptorily refused to join the plot. So, as
you may suppose, thinking to be on the open seas
in a few days, I stepped into the mate’s place at
once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I found the people at odds with the captain, and
all at sixes and sevens about the missing boat, which
some of them seemed to think Catherton had lost by
design. However, the more words I heard flying
up the forecastle scuttle, the more I felt inclined at
first to set this down as mere sea-babble, together
with some story about Mrs. Catherton’s death, which
I could not get hold of for a spell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, the fellows had been hard at work on
the last cruise, cutting in and trying out to their
hearts’ content, as the skipper had been very fortunate
in finding white whales among the islands of
the Gulf, where I have seen immense shoals of them
myself going in among the passages to feed upon the
eight-armed squids, which the pearl-divers, at some
of the fisheries, dread almost as much as the sharks.
The Tartar’s boats had been very successful, and
now that the ship was full and the anchor down, her
crew were resolute to make amends for their precious
outlay of labor, regular whaleman fashion, by
grumbling at every thing abaft, and getting up an
occasional quarrel with the boat-steerers—deeming
it otherwise a hardship to turn out to their meals,
or to a game of cards on their chest-lids.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In fact they were altogether—excepting the
second mate, the old carpenter, and a few old sea-dogs—as
green a set as ever stared at an island of
weed; and perfect torture it was, Mr. Afterblock,
to see the lubbers crawl out of the forecastle to make
a voyage to the scuttle-butt, or a long cruise, like so
many tortoises, fore and aft the deck. Two score
and more of young, able-bodied men they were, to
be sure, strong enough, I dare say, to tow a raft of
whales alongside in any latitude. But the mischief
of the thing was, that instead of the oil getting into
their joints and making them supple, it seemed to
have soddened brain and limb, until it fairly went
against your stomach to ask them a question, or to
call them aft to hoist up a boat to the cranes. Of
course I did not expect them to equal our dying top-men,
or the nimble Arabs from Darra, of whom my
crew were mostly composed in the grab—especially
as the mates hardly knew enough to put the ship
about. But, after having been twenty months at
sea, I did look for them to know one end of the ship
from the other; and considering the heat of the
weather and the number of desperate wretches
roaming in the harbor, it was not too much, you’ll
allow, to have them keep anchor-watch, or to wash
down decks at daybreak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish, Mr. Miller,” said Dicky, “that we had
a few of the slowest of ’em here. Green’s nigh to
blue; and the higher you mount up in a squall, the
sooner you’ve got to come down. Why, the lubbers
would have blessed the service to their dying days,
for making men of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay,” resumed the master’s mate, “I’ve seen
the same thing again and again. However, the
captain, who spent most of his time on shore, at
the house of an old Parsee merchant, to whom he
had letters from some port where he had touched in
the Persian Gulf, checked me more than once, intimating
that it was best to let them have their own
way, until we got into the open seas again, which,
he said—although I saw no indications of it—would
be in a few days, as soon as he had finished some
business which he had with the old Parsee. He
had seemed all along to have something deeper in
his eye, and, in fact, told me in confidence, the very
next evening, that he had been offered a large sum
in hand to land at a small port a short distance from
Muscat, a beautiful Circassian slave of the Sultan’s,
named Zuma, and the departure of the ship was only
delayed until the woman could make her escape from
the castle. This gave me some uneasiness, as I had
heard that Zuma had passed from the old Parsee’s
household into that of the Sultan; and apart from
the difficulty of baffling the black eunuch who had
charge of Syed Seeyd’s harem, I dreaded being involved
in the plot I have alluded to, to depose that
monarch in favor of his cousin, whose father Seeyd
had put to death with his own hand at some castle
near Rostak. Moreover, I had good reasons for
knowing that my friend, the Arab chief, Halil ben
Hamet, who was deeply engaged in the conspiracy,
was the favorite lover of Zuma. However, as it was
Catherton’s affair, of course I could do nothing but
look about me the sharper, and see all ready to go to
sea at the shortest warning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment some one interrupted the mate by
calling out that the whale was off at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something must have <span class='it'>gallied</span> him,” said the
man; “yonder he goes, head out, like a channel-packet
steaming against wind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was Darby Rattlesnake’s hanged ugly figure-head,”
observed the gruff captain of the forecastle,
who was standing within ear-shot of the group—“d—n
me, if he be’n’t ugly enough to shear the
whole coast of Greenland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having thus seriously hurt the feelings of the
honest old tar, who was quietly looking out to windward,
the petty officer winked at his fellows, screwing
his own mahogany visage, polished as it was by
the moonlight, into a miniature maelstrom of wrinkles,
which commenced at the caverns of his fierce, pertinacious
eyes, and wriggled gradually off at the tail
of his beard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mate started up just in time to catch a glimpse
of the whale’s back, with the flukes in full play, and
a long line of white water behind it. He was going
at a tremendous pace straight in the wind’s eye,
and, while the mate followed him with his eye, suddenly
plunged sheer down where the dazzle was
brightest; and before the man could draw a second
breath, had disappeared. It was impossible to say
what had started him; but the old seamen declared
that these large solitary whales always steer a course
as duly as a ship; and that, having satisfied himself
that the frigate was the Old Ironsides, and nothing
else, he was now only making up for lost time, in
resuming his course. For my part, I thought it possible
that, as he wallowed on his side, or raised his
head from the hollow of a swell, his eye might have
caught a glimpse of the canvas with the moonlight
on it, as he was at one time so close to the ship’s
side, that a smart harpooner might have darted an
iron into his back from the chains. Be that as it
may, off he was, and as Miller turned from gazing
on his long dim track, and the stir created by his
sudden disappearance sank, an unusual degree of
quiet seemed to settle down from aloft, over rigging,
spars, boats and batteries, and indeed over every
spot of light and shade on the frigate’s deck. In the
midst of this you could plainly hear the murmur of
voices in the tops, and an occasional flap of the lighter
duck, as some loftier sail stirred and was at rest
again, like a living thing in a dream—while every
shadowy port and silent gun on the spar-deck, appeared
for the time, by the soft witchery of moonlight,
the abode of peaceful repose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fact was, the breeze was gradually failing from
aloft, and we were going to have a flat calm, as was
easy to see from the hazy look of the sky where the
land lay, and the sluggish heaves of the sea, growing
shorter and shorter, as if to put us in mind of the
far-famed bay to which we were bound; while, as
you thought of this, something of the “<span class='it'>dolce far
niente</span>” came over you, and walking across the
deck to glance at the pirate schooner to leeward, it
became difficult to connect the view with the stirring
scenes of the chase, until the eye, aided by the
night-glass, distinguished the ragged white streaks
in the side of the prize, and turning round again, you
saw the sentry at the dark hatchway, listening, as
he shifted arms, to the groans which rose, as it
seemed, from the very depths of the ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There were only a few antique-looking dows,”
continued the mate, “the grab-brig and one Arab man-of-war
moored in the gap where we lay, which, in my
opinion—melted out of me, as I may say—is the hottest
place in the round world in the same parallel of latitude;
being shut in by a wall of glaring granite—two
hundred feet high—on one hand, and a rampart
of rough rocks—rising high above the Tartar’s royal
truck—on the other. You hardly felt a breath of air
come on deck when you might; and it really seemed
to grow hotter and hotter, as the disease spread in
the town; the sky, all the time, like glowing steel
by day, and so clear and close at night, that you
turned away from the stars and the sickening light
of the moon, longing, as you panted for breath, for
the least mutter of thunder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“However, it was some comfort that as yet the
disease had not boarded the craft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Tartar was on old ship, as rickety as a
county bridge of our grandsires’ times, though having
been a regular tea-wagon in her best days, she
had known little crowding and banging. There was
still a deal of wear and tear in her leewardly black
hull, though I couldn’t say much for its model,
which was as near like one of those large Pennsylvania
wagons as might be, considering that one was
rigged for crossing the seas, and the other the mountains.
She had a respectable look, however, if it
were only for her size, with her ten gun-ports on a
side, her high rails, and a whale-boat on each bow,
waist and quarter, except the larboard one, where the
mate’s had hung. She was well sparred, her standing
rigging being entirely new that voyage, and her
ground-tackle of the very best. I noticed this from
the first, not dreaming at the moment, that I should
have greater cause to remember it afterward. She
had two cabins between decks, both of which, as I
understood, had been occupied by the captain and
his deceased wife—the mates sleeping in the house
under the poop, while the boat-steerers, as is the
custom in these ships, messed in the steerage. The
mulatto steward, who had been several voyages
with the captain, slung his hammock in the sail-room.
Since the unfortunate death of the lady, the
after-cabin had been closed, the doors being locked,
and the keys, as I was told, in the steward’s possession.
The long cabin in which we dined, and which
was separated from the steerage by an unusually
strong bulk-head partition, had two small sleeping-berths
in it, and over each of which was a star of
pistols. A number of boarding-pikes and ship’s cutlasses
were ranged round the mast, and a double
stand of short muskets gave the midship bulk-head—set
off as it was with a few <span class='it'>krungars</span><a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a> and Malayan
kreeses—a very warlike appearance. In the
sail-room, which was partitioned off from the for’ard
cabin, were ranged in order, in their sheaths, the instruments
used in capturing and cutting up the whale,
consisting of harpoons, long steel-headed lances,
fluke-spades, two-edged boarding-knives, and heavy
cutting-spades, all kept in excellent order. In showing
these implements to me, the second-mate remarked
that, as their legitimate work was done for
that voyage, it was well enough to have them under
his eye, particularly as there were several desperate
characters in the ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This second mate was an active, stirring young
fellow, certainly an exception to the others. From
him and the old Kennebunk carpenter, I afterward
learned many particulars of the cruise, which were
not set down in the log. The former, at first, appeared
to regard me with some dislike, which was
natural enough; coming unexpectedly, as I did—it
was hard to tell from where—between him and the
chief officer’s berth, to which, of course, on the
mate’s death, he felt himself entitled. It was just
as these jealous notions had worn off, and we were
beginning to feel fair and above board toward each
other, that the captain sent the steward up one evening,
after supper, to say that he wished to see me
below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Mr. Miller,’ said he, in a low voice, as soon as
I followed the mulatto down; ‘there is a friend of
yours in the after-cabin, who wishes to see you on
particular business.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He pointed to the door as he spoke, and observing
that it was open, and a light shining within, I
entered at once; when, to my surprise, I found my
friend, the Arab chief, Halil Ben Hamet, disguised
as a fisherman, seated before a table covered with
papers; his scimetar and a brace of pistols lying
within reach of his hand. He saluted me after the
Arab fashion, by taking my hand and placing it on
his head; and perceiving that Captain Catherton had
followed me in, I stood in silence, awaiting an explanation,
which, to say the truth, I dreaded. However,
his business with me after all was not exactly
what I expected, knowing him to be one of the conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seemed that Halil had already reason to fear
spies on his track, and anticipating some treachery
which might involve the life of Zuma the Circassian,
had made arrangements to remove her from the
harem to the ship, on the night fixed for the rise.
It was useless to gainsay him in this, as he had already
settled the thing with the captain, and I knew
that he was strongly attached to the female, for
whose sake he had run repeated risks under the very
eyes of the eunuch. Moreover, he had saved my
life when I was beset by assassins near the old Portugese
chapel; and I had been his confidant in his
intrigue with Zuma, having more than once kept
guard at the foot of the castle-wall, while one of the
Sultan’s household, who was in Halil’s interest, had
admitted him within a secret gate. Accordingly, as
soon as he had opened his plans to me, I readily
agreed to be at the small rift of sand under the castle
an hour after midnight, on Saturday evening—this
being Thursday—for the purpose of bringing off the
woman; Halil having, by the help of some of his
friends on shore, already arranged matters, so that—even
if the plot should fail—the search for Zuma
would be diverted in an entirely different direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘But, gentlemen,’ said I, in Arabic, looking at
Captain Catherton, who understood something of the
language, ‘we must look sharp. That black villain
is as cunning as the old serpent himself, where women
are concerned. He’ll have the ship searched
from truck to kelson, if it were only for the chance
of getting me in a scrape—depend upon it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well,’ answered the captain in English, while
his dark face grew a shade paler by the lamp, ‘it’s
worth some risk, and I am determined to run it. I’d
go after the lady myself, only I think you can manage
the thing better, knowing every nook of the cove
and the ground about the castle as well as you do.
Besides,’ he added, in a way which made me glance
round the cabin—where, by the way, I had never
been before—‘it’s a true love-affair; and by the
rules of blue-water, you know, we’re bound to help
them out.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I am ready,’ I replied, ‘to risk my life twice
over for the chief, and to circumvent that accursed
eunuch; but I don’t like involving the Tartar.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I shall sail on Sunday evening,’ interrupted he,
with something of the manner in which he lorded it
over the other mates. ‘The English frigate goes to
sea to-morrow, as one of her lieutenants told me in
the Bazaar this morning; we’ll take her berth as
soon as she weighs, and the next day but one, we’ll
be off with the land-winds.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Very good, sir,’ I answered, turning round to
return to the for’ard cabin, while he went on to explain
what had passed to the chief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How the latter came on board unperceived, even
in his disguise, was a mystery to me, accustomed as
I was, by this time, to the ways of the country. I
had been on deck nearly all day, with my eyes pretty
much about me, and the crew had strict orders to
prevent any strangers coming into the ship without
my consent, on account of the disease prevailing on
shore. However, he might have been smuggled into
the Tartar at night, and been on board more or
less, for a week, for aught that I knew to the contrary,
as I had not seen or heard of him myself,
since he made his last attempt to induce me to join
the conspiracy, the very day on which the whale-ship
came in. In fact, I remembered the moment I
had leisure to think, that the canoe in which Captain
Catherton usually paddled himself on shore, had been
missed from the mizzen-chains for some hours a few
nights before. I had been apprehensive that the
chief would renew his solicitations for me to take
part in the plot, as he seemed to set an unnecessary
store upon it, having all along ascribed the late attempt
upon my life as having originated with the
Sultan; who, he said, had taken umbrage at my
leaving his service in the hasty manner which I did.
I knew this to be a mistake, for reasons which it is
immaterial to mention; and, believing Syed Ben
Seeyd, apart from his toadyism to the English, to
be a wise and just prince, as the customs of the
east go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had always refused to have any concern in the
business. I had now good cause for fearing that the
scheme was about to explode on the heads of those
who devised it, especially after the captain beckoned
me back, and I found that Halil was to meet the ship
at a point on the Arabian coast, where a brother of
his commanded a fort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was impossible to resist his appeal to assist
him, with the scimetar, as it were, hanging over
both their heads; accordingly, I pledged my faith to
bring her off to the ship, provided she could get
safely out of the castle, the captain undertaking to
secrete her on board, in spite, as he said, of devil or
eunuch. I could not help, however, renewing my
caution to Halil, whom, Catherton said, he could
conceal at the same time, if the conspiracy should
be discovered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“However, the chief appeared to be pretty confident,
and our plans being settled, after drinking a
glass or two of Muscadene, I made my salaam and
went on deck. The night was as hot as usual, the
land-wind blowing like a fire-blast, or as the captain—who
had been in the Brazils, and who soon followed
me up—said, like the breath of an <span class='it'>engenho</span>, during
crop-time. In fact, in the silence of the harbor, the
dim wall of rocks on either side of the passage
seemed glowing with heat, until one almost fancied
that he saw the very lights on shore dancing in the
tremulous motion of the air, just as he had seemed
to see the stones and bushes at noon; while every
now and then, a bat, as large as a pigeon, wheeled
past your ear, and some sort of sand-piper, common
on that coast, sent up its whistle, in two mellow,
plaintive notes, as if it were too hot for even the
birds to sleep. Whether it was fancy or not, the
place seemed to smell like a vast charnel-house, still
as it was at that hour—the disease still spreading in
the town, and having even boarded one or two of the
Arab craft, as I knew. However, Catherton, I must
say, appeared to stand it easily enough, sitting under
the awning on the poop, with his broad breast bare,
and a sheroot in his teeth. Boats were passing from
the English frigate to the town, which was out of
sight from where we lay, and after some remarks
about her going to sea the next day, Catherton quietly
asked me, if I had ever heard an opinion expressed
on shore, respecting the beauty of Zuma, the Circassian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘She is uncommonly handsome, I suppose,’
said he, seeing that I hesitated to answer his question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘So report says,’ I replied; ‘though, as you
may suppose, few can boast of having seen her
face.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘They say,’ continued he, pursuing the subject,
‘that she cost the sultan a round sum; for she is not
his wife, as I understand from the old Parsee, but
only his favorite slave. It is natural enough for
her to hate him, as they say he has four wives already.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Why,’ said I, getting into a gossiping strain myself,
to relieve my mind of more serious thoughts, as it
were, ‘Syed Ben Seeyd is too strong-minded, and has
too keen a sense of his own interests, to suffer any
fair face of them all to make a fool of him. His
last wife, the daughter of the Shah of Persia, he
married, of course, purely from policy, though it is
well known that he has no issue by any of the
rest.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘However,’ said Catherton, ‘he is likely to
make short work with Zuma, if she should be
caught in <span class='it'>flagrante delicto</span>, as the lawyers say;
the sack, or the bowstring, or the scimetar, I suppose.
But, do you your part in bringing her off,
and I’ll hide her from the eunuch, even if his eyes
were sharp as the wise old Greek’s, when he found
out Achilles beneath his petticoats.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was not surprised at language like this; for I
had already discovered that Catherton had been educated
above his present condition; it was rather
something in his manner that struck me, quiet as it
was, as if under an air of confidence—which the
chief’s business naturally created between us—he
wished to get at something uppermost in his mind,
without my suspecting aught.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He said little more worthy of repetition, and
after a while, I turned in, leaving him still smoking
on the poop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next morning he went on shore, as usual,
after giving me orders on what he wished to have
done in the ship. At daylight we commenced breaking
out a portion of the cargo, to get at a leak—the
ship having touched on a reef on the late cruise.
The carpenter was lucky enough to find this, and
after stopping it, the cooper and his mates were
driving some of the old casks, when a difficulty occurred
between a boat-steerer and some of the
people. In putting an end to this, I found the fellows
were determined to see the sort of man they had
to deal with, some of them using mutinous expressions,
and finally making a rush for the poop to rescue
a rascally Portuguese, whom the mates had placed
in irons. Driven for’ard of the mainmast, three or
four of the worst of the scoundrels attempted to turn
a gun inboard, when the second mate and I, well
seconded by the rest, and the five harpooners, dashed
in among them with the capstan bars, and after
cracking a few crowns in true merchantman’s style,
drove the rest <span class='it'>pell-mell</span> down the scuttle. We then
secured a few more of the ringleaders, and turned all
hands to again, not a man daring to refuse work in
a full ship, which, as the second mate remarked,
showed that they had some dim glimmering of their
own interests, after all. The English frigate went
to sea with the first of the land-wind, and we began
to weigh as soon as I saw that her anchor was
a-peak. According to orders, I warped close to the
mouth of the passage, anchoring, with the stream,
a little astern of the Englishman’s old berth, and
carrying a hawser to the rocks. This brought us
ahead of the grab and the Arab corvette, and so near
to the entrance as to prevent any craft which might
come in from taking a berth so as to crowd us should
we wish to tow out suddenly; nevertheless, we
were still lying within the shadow of either shore,
with an eye to the secret business which the captain
had on hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After we were all snug, I examined our stock
of water, and found enough to last us to the Cape of
Good Hope, or to St. Helena, as Catherton had said
something of touching there. There was a strong
prejudice in the ship against using the water from
the wells of Muscat, and, accordingly, the captain
had resolved, if the quantity was sufficient to reach a
half-way port, to go to sea with the stock on hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After dinner, while smoking our sheroots on the
poop, the second mate, for the first time, spoke in
very decided terms of the detention of the ship, dropping
at the same time certain mysterious hints,
which I determined that he should at once unravel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘But, Mr. Parker,’ said I, accordingly, in answer
to one of those dubious remarks, ‘Captain
Catherton keeps matters pretty close, and to my
notion, he is not exactly the man to answer a straight-forward
question, even if you had made up your mind
to ask it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You may swear to that, sir,’ answered he,
coming near the point at once—‘that is, to his having
cause to keep things close. To tell the plain
truth, sir, I’ve had my doubts of him, more or less,
the whole v’y’ge; especially,’ continued he, sinking
his voice, ‘since we lost the mate in the way we
did—and since his wife’s spirit has haunted the
ship.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I scarce knew what to think of this, as the man
spoke quite seriously, glancing warily round the poop,
and dropping his voice to a whisper, which had
something of genuine awe in its cadence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Come, come, Mr. Parker,’ said I, ‘no ghosts,
if you please. We will leave them to the old carpenter
and his crony. I should like to hear, though,
how you lost that boat’s crew.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well, sir,’ he replied, doggedly, ‘as you please—but
as for the spirit—’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Pooh, pooh, man!—never mind that!—tell me
how you came to lose the boat. We will have the
spirit after supper, if you insist on it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Why,’ said he, with a sort of sigh, dropping the
ghost with evident reluctance, ‘I had to cut my line
in that same squall, for it was in running down to
pick up my boat that the ship lost sight of the mate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You see, sir,’ continued he, after a pause,
during which he looked me full in the face in a half
shrewd, half wistful way, as I thought, ‘it is best to
begin at the right end of a tangled yarn, if you want
to unravel it. Some of the boat’s crew-watch heard
a splash under the counter one moonlight night in
the Gulf, and when the rest opened their eyes and
went aft, the poop was empty, and the lady not to
be found in the ship. One fellow saw her standing
by the head of the after-cabin stairs, when he went
aft to strike the bell a moment before—another heard
the splash—but when the boats were dropped, nothing
was to be seen on the long, dazzling swell of
the sea but the back-fin of a large blue shark, veering
slowly round between the boats and the ship, as
if he had missed his prey—except it were a gull
asleep, with its head under its wing—or the fresh
branches of a tree, drifting toward the mouth of the
Gulf, on the current of the dry monsoon. As she
was not to be found in the ship, it was almost certain
that she had been leaning over the counter,
watching the shark, perhaps, and losing her balance,
had perished before she had time to utter a single
cry—at least so the captain professed to think.
However, it was the next day but one after that,
just as the lookouts were going aloft at daybreak,
we raised a large shoal of half-grown whales,
crossing the ship’s wake, about two miles off, between
Gigot and the low island of Ippoo. It was a
likely place to meet with whales coming down the
Ippoo passage at this season, and as soon as the
captain got a look at the spouts from aloft, we wore
round at once. The sea was too rough to make
them out from deck before they peaked flukes<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a>; and
as the ship was under single-reefed topsails at the
time, he must have noticed the fresh squall rising
over the land before he sent away the boats. To be
sure, two forty-barrel bulls would have filled us up.
And after the accident to the lady, every soul in the
ship, as you may suppose, was anxious to see the
tryworks hove in the sea, and sail made for home.
Be that as it may, when the word was given to
back the main-yard, instead of the captain sliding
down a backstay, in his hurry to be first, Mr. Jinney,
the mate, came slowly down the rigging, and kicking
off his shoes, without a word, got into his boat.
He steered to windward about a mile, allowing for
the Tartar’s drift, and then peaked his oars, paddling
from time to time, to keep his place, head to sea—the
wind fresh’ning all the while, and the clouds
rolling together over the land, while the swells got
up so fast between the high bluff of Gentoo on the
larboard hand, and Divers’ Bank on the other, that
we could only see the mate and his harpooner, standing
up on the lookout, when the boat rose on the top
of a sea. I was looking every minute for the order
to hoist the recall signal—as we use no ‘waifs’ in
this ship—when the infernal whales rose close to the
boat, and almost as soon as we knew they were up,
the male was fast. The shoal ‘squandered’<a id='r6'/><a href='#f6' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[6]</span></sup></a>—some
running toward Gentoo, and some coming down
toward the ship. I was so eager to head off these
last, when the captain sung out to me from the crosstrees
to lower away, that I forgot all about the
weather, thinking only of the fish, as you may easily
understand, if you have any notion of the heat into
which things of this sort put a whaleman. However,
it was not until I had my whale spouting his last to
leeward of the ship, that the squall came down on
us sharp as a knife—cutting off the heads of the seas
before it, and nearly swamping the boat, as we
labored to keep her close under the whale’s lee.
After he turned up we kept head to sea, until the
ship came driving down in the thick of it, with her
three topsail-yards on the caps, and luffing up to the
gust, brought us close under her lee, so that we
managed to hook on and scramble inboard, just as
the rain came down in a solid sheet.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You saw no more of the mate, then?’ I asked,
as he stopped short, jerking the stump of his sheroot
into the scum which floated round the rudder, and
staring at the birds which darted after it, and then
at the Arab cruiser, in an earnest, yet vacant way,
which showed that his mind, being full of his tale,
or something at the bottom of it, took no more note
of the craft, at the moment, than if she had been up
the Ganges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No, sir,’ he answered slowly, ‘for it was thick
and squally for a day or two afterward, and we had
nearly lost the ship the same day, on a coral-reef.
There was a grab-brig in sight to windward at the
time, and we had hopes that she might have picked
up the mate’s boat, only that Captain Catherton
swore that he saw the whale run it under before the
squall shut them in; which, as the third mate, who
was aloft at the time, afterwards said, showed that
his glass must have had devilish sharp eyes.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well,’ said I, as he stopped short again, with a
world of meaning in his sharp face, ‘I commanded
that grab, and I must say your ship was handled
well to have steered clear that time. We saw no
more of you after the squall struck us, and really it
seems to me that Captain Catherton did the best he
could under the circumstances; since if he had kept
his luff, instead of bearing away before it, it’s more
than probable he would have lost two boats’ crews,
in place of one.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Very true,’ said he, in a negative sort of a way;
‘but then, I doubt the truth of the captain’s report
that the whale took the boat under. The third mate
was on the topgallant-crosstrees, with his glass
fixed on the boat, when they put their helm up in
the ship, and he says that the fish never sounded at
all. No man in his senses would have sent away a
boat in such weather; and it was the very first time
on the v’y’ge that the starboard quarter-boat—the
captain’s own—hung at the cranes, and the main-yard
aback for a shoal of whales within half a mile of the
ship.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘He was fond of the sport, then?’ said I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Ay,’ he answered, ‘he is famous for making
short v’y’ges, and a bolder whaleman never went
over a ship’s side—though he wasn’t bred to the
work, either. He never let the chance slip before
of having the first dash at a shoal, setting great store
on a trick of his own, of pitchpoling a lance, that
was very certain. He has killed two whales to the
mate’s one, for the v’y’ge—though his boat was
oftener under the carpenter’s hands—as he had a
slap-dash way of laying on to a whale, which suited
no other harpooner in the ship, but the wild islander
who steers him.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘He believed in the South-Sea-slogan,’ said I,
‘a dead whale, or a stove boat.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Just so,’ he replied, apparently beguiled of
deeper thoughts, for an instant, by a natural interest
in his profession; ‘and his boat’s crew were all pretty
much of the same creed. Two of the fellows we had
in irons below belong to it; and more troublesome
rascals are not to be found in the ship. However,
the difference between the captain and the mate in
their boats, was this: the one was too headstrong,
the other too cautious. Once within dart of a shoal,
the captain would have three or four fish spouting
blood, before the mate could clear away his lance;
though Jinney was always more sure to get on to a
single whale—an old schoolmaster, for instance—if
you only gave him time; and he rarely had his boat
struck. However,’ continued he, recurring to the
point which, I could see, troubled him most, ‘I never
dreamed that Jinney, cunning as he was, would have
died in the strange way he did.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Why, Mr. Parker,’ said I, glad to find him falling
back to his starting-point, ‘I have heard nothing,
so far, to justify your suspicions of the captain. The
ghost is out of the question, and as Catherton got
along very well with his mate for two successive
voyages as you say, I cannot see his motive for
wishing Jinney out of the ship in the damnable way
you point at.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Ay,’ said he solemnly, ‘but there was a motive—and
a black one. Nothing will ever convince me
to the contrary, but that the poor lady had foul play
between the three of them—I mean her husband,
the mate, and the mulatto steward.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The devil!’ I broke out, staring him full in the
face, with a confused remembrance of some strange
thoughts of my own in my mind. ‘What on earth
put that horrid notion in your head?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The lines deepened on the second mate’s shrewd
face, and a doubtful look wrinkled his narrow brows,
as his eyes watched mine, as if to fathom how far he
might trust me in such a matter. It would not do,
however, and I saw that he felt compelled to speak,
at all risks, like a frank fellow, as he was, who had
strong doubts of dark deeds done in the craft—he
could not tell exactly how—and was taking the first
good chance that turned up, of easing his mind.
There was a look of honest trouble about his
twinkling blue eyes, and beardless swarthy cheek,
which, combined with his Yankee shrewdness—setting
aside the stuff about the ghost—made me
repeat the question in a sharper tone, as my mind
again reverted to something I had heard before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The truth is, sir,’ said he, ‘I was convinced
from the first, that Mrs. Catherton came on board
against her will. Something seemed wrong between
them from the start; for I remember, just after she
was getting over her sea-sickness, I began to observe
the traces of tears on her face, as she often came
hurriedly up on the poop, when he was in the after
cabin. It was even a matter of talk for’ard, before
the blacksmith’s forge was off deck,<a id='r7'/><a href='#f7' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[7]</span></sup></a> that he treated
her ill; and as this belief gradually worked aft, from
<span class='it'>that</span> end of the ship, before we had harpooned a single
whale, you may swear that it was true. I heard
him, myself, from the sail-room, one morning when
he made sure I was asleep in the house on deck,
twitting her with her want of faith toward him, and
telling her how smoothly she had carried it on for
years, while he was at sea—she praying and moaning
all the time, and calling on God to witness her
innocence; while the very sound of her voice—to
say nothing of her tears and her prayers—was enough
to move the heart of a Turk to believe her. She
could not abide the sight of the mate; and the worst
of it was, he seemed to know well enough in his
heart what it was for—in short, sir, I had sailed
with Jinney before, and had ought to know him. As
sure as every man’s conscience is an inward comforter
or a scourge of scorpions in this life, according
as he listens to its voice or not, so sure that man
hated himself as he went about the decks. It was
noticed by all hands that he never spoke to her, nor
she to him, although she used to sit, for hours at a
time, on the poop, with a book on her knees, watching,
as we drove along, something you could not
see in the wake of the ship, or it might be a gull,
hovering over the track of foam; or a Mother Carey’s
chicken walking the sprays. All this time we were
taking whales, and as the captain showed nothing
of the tyrant in his usage of the crew, and the Tartar
was a better found ship than I ever had the luck to
have been in before, the people had nothing to grumble
about, except the matters aft, which, to be sure,
was no concern of theirs. Either Captain Catherton,
or Jinney, or the mulatto, were always watching the
poor lady on the sly, so that it must have been when
the boats were off, and the steward at the braces
with the shipkeepers, that she managed to stow
away the letter that I found in my pea-jacket pocket
nearly a week after she disappeared. It was addressed
to some friend of hers on shore, and she
must have watched until she discovered where the
jacket hung, and risked the chances; for the letter
was wrapped up in the blank leaf of a book, with a
few words in pencil-mark on the margin, begging
me to deliver it to the address, if ever I had an opportunity
to do so. She was lost a week before I
found the letter, and though it looks something like
it,’ continued he, while his blue eyes glistened, ‘I’ll
never believe that she drowned herself, as she never
complained aloud; but just grew thinner and thinner,
day by day, until it was plain to the dullest head in
the ship, that she was pining to death. It’s my settled
belief that she had other reasons for thinking her
end was near, and that the spirit that haunts the ship
is hers. But be that as it may,’ said he solemnly,
‘if Jim Parker ever lives to see the States again, he
will travel to the ends of the earth to deliver the
letter. Now, if there’s trouble ahead, Mister Miller,
thank God, I’m ready to meet it with a clear
conscience.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Mr. Parker,’ I said, still believing the story to
be an exaggeration, in spite of the horrible twist he
had given it; ‘your counsel is safe with me; but if
you’ll take my advice, you’ll say nothing more of
the captain’s wife, or the mate, until the voyage is
up. If there has been foul play, depend upon it, it
will come out.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Just so,’ said he, ‘and if you had not been the
kind of man I take you for, I should not have
broached a word to you, seeing that you are a
stranger to me, and seem to have met with Captain
Catherton before.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The truth is,’ I answered, ‘I have been haunted
with such a notion, ever since I boarded the ship in
the offing; but as I have repeatedly racked my memory
in vain to account for the impression, I begin
to think that we must have met in a dream, or that
my mind has been misled by a fancied resemblance
to some one else, whom I have forgotten. However,’
said I, by way of a finale, ‘if he has murdered
his wife and the boat’s crew in the way in which
you suspect, depend upon it, he is as certain to swing
in the wind, as a ship to her anchor, in a tide-way.
In the meantime, it is best to say as little about the
matter as possible—and you may as well turn the
people too, and have the head-sails unbent.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Very good, sir,’ answered Parker, and down
the poop-stairs he went, while I dove into the sail-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While the crew were sending up new sails in
place of the old top-sails and courses—worn as thin
as sere leaves, blackened with the sooty smoke of
the try-works, and marked in fifty places, from the
yard-arms down, with gurry—the captain came off,
with the old Parsee in company. I, immediately,
made my report to him of the difficulty which had
occurred in the morning, which he seemed disposed
to treat lightly, informing me in turn, that Halil Ben
Hamet had gone ashore before daylight, and had arranged
every thing for the escape of Zuma on Saturday
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The blow is to be struck,’ he whispered, ‘at
midnight, and on Sunday evening we weigh.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He then went below, and in a few minutes afterward,
as I stood in the gangway, overlooking the
preparations for sea, the two came up on the raised
deck, for the sake of the current of air, which was
felt or fancied under the awning of the poop. They
were both in high spirits; the captain laughing and
making the best use of his Arabic, with an occasional
fragment of Persian, which he had picked up in his
cruises; while the grave, ghostly Parsee—whose
thin, bloodless face, and attenuated figure, seemed to
set the boiling-point at defiance—sat under the awning,
cosily ensconced in a bamboo arm-chair, his
back at a luxurious angle, his slippered feet nestling
in a sort of carved stool, which wheeled from beneath,
and the bowl of his crooked pipe resting on
the hot, white deck. He had exchanged his high,
purple cap, embroidered with white flowers, for another
of lighter make and smaller dimensions, the
peak of which overhung and contrasted oddly with
his orange cheek; and as the men swaying on the
buntlines, squinted oft at his collarless white tunic,
and calm, passionless face, with the scented smoke
curling up in blue wreaths from the thin mustache,
to the gurgle of his hookah, you’d’ve almost thought
the fellows took the old Tartar’s poop for some odd
corner of the eastern paradise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was dreaming of some such thing myself, when I
was suddenly startled by a half-smothered shriek from
aft, coming, as it seemed to me, from the cabin under
the raised deck. The mulatto steward, who happened
to be passing along to the galley, dropped his
basket of dishes with a crash, while Catherton himself,
grew pale as death, sitting still on the poop, as
it appeared, without the power to move a limb.
The steward, however, without waiting to count
the fragments of his dinner-plates, ran precipitately
down the cabin stairs, while the second mate, who
was standing near the break of the deck, speaking to
the men on the mizzen-topsail-yard, slued half-round,
turning as white as the canvas. Catching my eye,
he stood fast again, continuing his orders; though
both he and the men aloft, who heard the cry distinctly
enough, were sufficiently startled to show
what they thought of it. One great, clumsy fellow,
slipping off the foot-ropes in his fright, when, doubtless
he would have made a ghost of <span class='it'>himself</span>, had not
a boat-steerer caught him by the breast of his duck-frock,
and jerked him up on the yard again. For my
part, seeing the superstitious fears of the rest, and
noticing the change on the captain’s face, a strong
contrast to his look a moment before, when he was
carrying it off so pleasantly, I did not know what
to make of it, thinking one instant of Catherton’s deceased
wife, and the next of the Circassian Zuma,
who, it flashed upon me, might have been brought
on board without my knowledge. In a few moments,
however, the steward came up on the poop
with the monkey clinging to him, and told the captain,
that one of the mutinous rascals whom we had
confined below, had worked off his irons, and breaking
open a small slide between the steerage and the
store-room, had frightened master Jocko into hystericks.
I caught the second mate’s eye seeking
mine again at this; and Catherton called out from
where he sat, to release the men, and turn them to
with the rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This was done, and nothing more said of the occurrence
at the time, for a breeze suddenly sprung
up, bringing in another of the sultan’s cruisers, which
had been in sight in the offing all day, with a fleet of
dows in convoy. She was a heavy frigate, with an
English name, which I have forgotten. She came
to anchor on the flood, abreast of the palace at the
bottom of the cove, while the great, clumsy dows,
moored in the passage astern of the grab-brig.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Parsee merchant went on shore just after
dark; and being engaged on deck until late in the
evening, I had no particular conversation with the
captain that night. Awaking from an uneasy sleep
about midnight, I went on deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The harbor was still as death. The hot
breath of the land-wind had failed. Not a cloud was
to be seen on the sky, where the moon and the stars
shone with resplendent beauty. The heat was excessive,
the least exertion causing the perspiration to
stream from the pores. All at once, as I leaned over
the quarter, listening to a stir which sprung up on
board of my old brig, which had been dismantled and
turned into a floating hospital, it struck me that I
heard a low murmur of voices, proceeding from the
galley of the Tartar. My curiosity being sharpened
by the shriek, which had so confused Captain
Catherton and the steward, and set Parker and I off
on opposite tacks—he thinking of a ghost, and I of
the Circassian—I walked slowly for’ard on the larboard
side of the deck, anxious to know what was
going on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I soon discovered that the two steerage cronies,
the carpenter and the cooper, with the sable master
of the coppers himself, were engaged in a solemn
conclave. The two whites were great friends;
though no two men could appear more unlike in person
and character. The carpenter, a Kennebunk
man, was short and thickset, as slow and heavy in
his motions as an elephant, with a broad, solemn
face, as beardless and bare of expression as a plain
of sand, with the nose like a ruined obelisk, rising
out of it; while the hooper of staves, as straight and
thin as a lath, with sharp features, restless, ferrety
eyes, and a nose like a cockatoo’s upper mandible,
was the very impersonification of an old blue presbyter,
on a cruise. These two fellows were the
chief manufacturers of the legends set afloat in the
ship; nothing escaping the cooper’s eyes and ears,
which was deemed worthy of being poured into the
carpenter’s brain, from whence, by the slow process
of infiltration, it was given in its strength, drop by
drop, as it were, to the crew. This I had learned
from the second mate; and as the slide of the galley
door was partly open on the side facing Muscat
Island, as if to let out the smoke of their pipes, and of
some mess the cook was coddling in his stew-pan, I
could not resist the temptation of turning eaves-dropper
for once, and accordingly, sat quietly down on
the spars to listen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man of chips was speaking, with the slow
gravity of an oracle, and as his dull, dogged voice
met my ear, I could not but think it fortunate that I
chanced to light upon the party at the very moment
I did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You think now, my lads,’ said he, ‘that you
have made a prime v’y’ge, with forty-five hundred
b’rr’ls sparm ile in the ship, and the tryworks down—you,
Bungs, with a good <span class='it'>lay</span><a id='r8'/><a href='#f8' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[8]</span></sup></a> and no finger in the
slop-chist—and the doctor, with his ten b’rr’ls of
slush extra, besides his perquisites for washing the
mate’s clothes for twenty odd months—wait till the
anchor’s down in Bedford Bay, before you crow,
my lads. For my part, unless some lucky chance,
as you knows nothin’ of now, turns up, I no more
looks to see home in this ship than I looks for to see
the new mate to turn missionary, or the skipper to
kneel down to the sun with the old Parshee—and
eyther aire a long way from my thoughts, I kin tell
you. Isn’t the ship haunted in the cabins; and
ar’n’t there two Jonases, at least, on board—and another
that I knows of—not to speak of him that’s
gone to his reckonin’, with murder on his soul, as
sartin as we three be settin’ here, as helpless as so
many gonies with fish-hooks in their beaks.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What kin a man do, Chips?’ answered the
cooper, apparently much moved with this pleasant
prospect of his crony’s. ‘If we stir tack or sheet,
in the way you seem to pint, it’s mutiny—and we
all know what that leads to. If we makes a complaint
to this here bashaw, or sultan, or whatsoever
he calls hisself, ten staves to a whitlin’, that the
skipper, or the old yaller nabob with the Teneriffe-cap—as
they say kin do a great deal here in his way—turns
it all into gammon. If you, old head, can
see through this traverse, why don’t you say so at
once—all among friends—instead of bullragin’ a feller
about a matter as he kin no more work out of than
a suckin’ whale kin stem a strong current?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here I could hear him whiffing his pipe in high
dudgeon, while the other, lowering his voice to a
true sea-croak, answered him all the cooler; feeling
his way, as I thought, to some plan of his own,
which I was doubly anxious to get at, as both men,
from their stations in the ship, had considerable influence
with the crew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Thar be some things so dark, d’ye mind,’ said
the oracle, ‘that no man kin see through ’em till the
Lord’s own time—and some as no man—not even them
as is concarned the deepest—kin give a reason for,
no more than you kin tell me why a whale always
dies with his head toward the sun. As I takes it,
this matter about the mate and the skipper’s wife be
of this sort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Hows’iver, this much be sartin—eyther we
must git rid o’ the two Jonases, which is left, or the
old Tartar are a doomed craft—ship and cargo.
Now, for the steward—t’other one once out of the
way—his hash is soon settled. I’d think no more
of fetchin’ him a clip with my adze than of strikin’
a shirk with a head-spade. I mistrusted the villain
iver since I fust sot eyes on the yaller frontispiece
of ’im, with his two gray toplights shinin’ like a
cat’s in the dark. He’s as deep in as t’other, and
without his reason, it may be—hows’iver, to the
pint—look ye, I says there’s only one man in the
ship which can manhandle the bloody skipper, if he’s
once put to the stumps.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Dat be Frank, de man-o’-war-man, I reckon,’
observed the cook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Or the Portagee,’ said the cooper, ‘or, if I’m
to have a second guess, nearer the mark, the Kanacker,
John Kapooley.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘John Kapooley be d—d! and the rest, too,’ said
old Kennebunk, scornfully. ‘I see it’s all lost time,
as the students say at Cambridge, to teach a nigger
a logic, or a bung-driver to sarcumvent any thing but
hoops, heads and staves,’ he muttered, pushing the
galley door farther open to empty his mouth, though,
luckily, he did not see me, as I sat close abaft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I say, mates, there’s but one man which kin
help us in this quandary—and that’s the new mate.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Why, Chips,’ said the cooper, ‘Lord love you,
he’s hand and glove with him you knows of. ’Taint
no manner of use of countin’ on him. He’d no
more listen to our story than the old Turk at the
paliss yonder. Besides, he’s used to sailin’ in other
sort of crafts altogether, and sticks up his nose at us
whalemen. He’s jist the same sort as the Jonas
hisself, and they two is bound to stick togither this
cruise—blow high, blow low—till wind and wave
parts ’em.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Dat bin ’xactly my notion, too,’ said the black,
‘him too much an out-an-out sailor to go agin de
captin.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well, Bungs,’ answered the carpenter, ‘it’s
many a long day since you’ve been to sea afore this
cruise, and you speak accordin’ to your lights, I dare
say. As to the doctor, why I can’t expect much
better of him, seein’ that he’s not long out of the
bonds o’ iniquity. (The cook was a runaway slave.)
But, you see, I’ve talked the whole matter over
with Browning, and Shadduck, and Frank, the man-o’-war’s-man,
as stands for the whole o’ the starboard-watch—and
says I to them, says I, what’s to
come o’ it, my lads, s’posin’ we <span class='it'>does</span> get the ship out
o’ this blessed mess—a ghost aft, the cholery, the
Turks and the tiffoons—and the bloody skipper runs
away with her, craft and cargo, after all—and leaves
us in some foreign port to go to grass with the greenhorns.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Why, where on airth could he run her to, I
want to know?” said the cooper. “If her invoice
were drugs and spices, now—or teas and silks, as in
her old days, you might talk; but, as I take it, old
head, it would be hard to find a market in any quarter
of the world, barrin’ Europe and the States, for
sich a cargo of sparm ile as we’ve under hatches.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘So you think, my lad,’ retorted the carpenter,
coolly, ‘ ’cause, old as you are, you ar’n’t up to half
the deviltry afloat now-a-days.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Mayhap, now, you ha’n’t forgot that old nob,
with the powdered head and the long cue, which
were as thick as three in a berth, with the skipper,
at Pernambuke?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Lord love you, no, Charley,’ answered his
crony. ‘I remembers him well enough, by reason
of the half-doubloon which he give the boat’s crew
for pickin’ up three of his niggers, when wild Frank
capsized their canoe in the harbor.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well, then,’ continued Charley, ‘Don Josey
Maria were his name, and the richest senor he were,
they said, between the <span class='it'>Recife</span> and the Rio.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well, Chips, what then?’ asked the cooper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Why,’ answered the other, as coolly as before,
‘it’s my belief, growin’ in me, the whull v’y’ge,
out of things as has turned up, one arter another,
that ship and cargo were as good as sold to that aire
old Portagee, afore we left the bloody Brazil coast
behind.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Why, Charley, man,’ said the cooper, in a startled
voice, ‘sure, you don’t mean to say that <span class='it'>now</span>,
and you niver broached a thought of it afore.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Why, you see, my hearties, I were watchin’
all along to see how the cat jumped, seein’ that the
skipper be nyther one to be skeared out of his course
by a trifle, nor fathomed with a bit o’ dry yarn like
a pump-well. I’m cock-sure of it now—but, hark’e
in your ears—one word from me, when we gits up
with the Cape, will block his game, deep as he is,
and sot that aire manhandlin’, pirate-huntin’ Mister
Miller—as he calls hisself—at t’other one’s throat
like a Bingal tiger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Hows’iver, jist travel aft, Bungs, an’ strike the
bell, whiles the doctor hands out the grog and the
prog—I reckon by that aire screechin’, which aire
none o’ the pleasantest, that the cholery’s set his
claws on more o’ the heathen.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I kept my seat while the man went aft and struck
the bell, the dismal echoes of the rocks drowning, for
a moment, the faint cries to which the carpenter had
alluded. Just as the man came back three or four
heads were thrust in succession up the forecastle
ladder, and as many of the larboard watch clustered
round the opposite door of the galley. The fellow
who had broken into the cabin was among them, and
recognizing the others as old hands, I sat close for a
few moments longer, although almost despairing
now of learning the magical word by which old
Charley was to set the captain and I by the ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“However, little of moment was said at first—the
talk turning chiefly on the heat, and the cholera, and
the prospect of getting to sea. One fellow was beginning
a story about the fever on the African coast,
when suddenly the carpenter asked the captain’s
stroke-oars-man, about the ghost he had seen in the
cabin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You see, mate,’ said Kennebunk, ‘the story they
made up aft about the jackanapes be all in my eye;
and if Frank, here, be of a mind, he can give us the
rights of it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘That be blowed!’ said the man-of-war’s man
in his wild way. ‘If it weren’t the monkey, with
a table-cloth round him, as the steward said, it might
have been a ghost, or the devil hisself, for all I care.
Pass the pannakin this way—here’s sweethearts
and wives, any how!—and no malice to the new
mate, for the clout on the sconce with the capstan-bar.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Ay, ay,’ rejoined the carpenter, ‘you men-of-war’s
men are all of one mark; you know one another,
meet where you may, jist as a shoal o’ whales
comes togither, arter a squanderin’.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘B—t me!’ said Frank, ‘if ever I sot eyes on
him afore he joined this ship, howsomever it may
be with you, Chips.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,’ said Charley again, ‘may be I have, and
may be I haven’t—I’m not goin’ for to say now.
Only so much, d’ ye see—he’s the very man to take
the old craft home, in case of any thing had happenin’
to the skipper. If we <span class='it'>do</span> go to sea on Sunday, as
is give out in the ship—what I want you lads of the
larboard watch to do, is to keep a small helm till we
once gits in the Cape latitudes. If the skipper lays
her course for the Brazil coast, then—leave the rest
to Charley Toppin.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well,’ answered Frank, ‘we’re all of one mind,
Chips; and if the soft-sawderin’, murderin’, buccaneerin’
thief tries his hand at that game, more than
half t’other watch’ll jine with us. You see, lads,
fair play’s a jewel, and I did promise the steward to
say nothin’ about what I seed in the after-cabin to-day—hows’iver,
as all hands is concarned—and you
all heerd the screach—why, sink me, if it’s a man’s
part to keep back the truth:—Either the ship’s
haunted by the captain’s wife’s ghost—or else he’s
got a live missus stowed away in the cabins.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was a regular burst of top-gallant oaths
and exclamations at this, until the carpenter took the
word in a sort of triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I knowed it—I knowed it—I told you all the
same thing—and who was most ready to laugh at
the spurrit but Frank—and now you hear him.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I only tell what <span class='it'>I</span> saw, shipmates,’ rejoined
the man-of-war’s man; you may believe what <span class='it'>you</span>
like.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘But let’s hear the rights of it, Frank,’ said the
cooper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well, then, you see,’ said Frank, after a pause,
‘when I slipped off my irons and got into the pantry,
looking for something to eat—for the rum dying in
me made me as ravenous as a wolf—the thought
comed into my head, somehow, to have a look at
the Bluebeard-chamber, as we calls the after-cabin
all along. I knowed the mates were busy on deck,
and the skipper ashore—and I heers the steward go
up with his dishes, afore I slipped back the slide—so,
mates, I walks like a cat in a game-preserve,
past the skipper’s berth, through the for’ard cabin—and
lays my hand on the nob of the door between.
Sure enough it were locked fast, and I outs sheath-knife
to pry back the bolt—and blessed if that very
minute the lock doesn’t turn from the inside. This
here you see, sets me all in a tremble, and I stands
still for a second, doubtin’ what to do, and more nor
half a mind to go back, as the thought of this here
ghost of the carpenter’s comes over me strong.
Hows’iver, ‘here’s venture,’ thinks I—and in I
bolts. What with the deadlights down, and something
over the bulls-eyes, it were as dark as a dungeon
at fust; but, as I feels my way in, somebody
moves on the poop—the light shoots down in a
stream—and I sees the wheel cabin pretty well,
with a rack full bottles and glasses between the doors,
and the two ship models we made on the fust cruise,
standing on their ways, safe enough on the transom.
I steps up to see what sort o’ stuff might be inside
the bottles, and never sees sign of monkey, nor nothing
else, ’till I give a look in a big looking-glass,
when blessed if I doesn’t see the door of the starboard
aftermost state-room open, and a woman in
white standin’ inside, lookin’ straight at me. I slues
round at this, and she gives the scream as some on
you heerd—and vanishes in a jiffy. Well, mates,
while I stands dumbfoundered at this, shakin’ worse
nor afore, the steward comes down the companion-way
like a hot shot, and shoves me back into the
pantry—and away he drives agin like mad. In less
than a minute he comes back, quiet enough, with a
tumbler of grog in his fist—and ‘Here,’ says he,
‘take this down, and say nothin’ to nobody about a
ghost at all—and I’ll lay it on the monkey.’ I nods
and swallows the stuff, and makes sail back to the
steerage, where the third mate comes down a minute
arter, and takes off the other chap’s bracelets, and
tells us all to turn to.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And now, mates,’ said he, ‘it’s all Bible
truth, jist as it took place; and whether it be a
ghost or no, it looked wonderful white and thin—and
as much like the poor lady, as if it were her
picter, full size, and done by some great painter—you
know.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The Lord have mercy on us!’ exclaimed the
cooper; ‘the likes of that I niver ’spected to hear
in this ship. But murder will out—and haunt the
cabins and the poop it’s sartain to do, as long as
there’s a Jonas left aboard.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Why,’ said another, ‘I’ve a notion to cut and
run from this here cussed craft to-morrow.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And lose your ile?’ suggested one fellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And die of the cholery, among rig’lar heathens,’
said the carpenter. ‘No, no, Jack; I’ll teach you a
better way nor that. Ye see, lads, while the spurrit
sticks to her end of the ship—’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here the ship’s bell struck one, and I went aft at
once. Not a soul was to be seen, though I walked
up on the raised deck, and then straight down to the
wheel, above which the clapper of the bell hung,
without the least motion that I could perceive. I
was puzzled myself, and as for the fellows in the
galley, they never stirred for the ten minutes which
I stood there, by the watch in the binnacle. At
length, one of the boldest made shift to get as far as
the mainmast, when, seeing me in my shirt-sleeves,
he took fright and ran for’ard again. I then went
below, more than half-inclined to leave the ship myself,
from what I heard; but determined, nevertheless,
to search the cabins myself, on the very first
occasion before we went to sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next morning we went on bending new
sails fore and aft, the captain going on shore in the
canoe after breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He had not been gone an hour, when a barge
came off to the ship, with the Sultan himself, the
Ouale<a id='r9'/><a href='#f9' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[9]</span></sup></a> of Muscat, and a few officers of his household—among
the rest my sable friend, Hadji Hemet,
looking blacker than a <span class='it'>fetisheer</span>, under a new Syrian
turban, with a jeweled <span class='it'>krungar</span> hanging at his girdle,
and pearls of price in his ears. Though they took
us by surprise, I had the sides manned, and the ship’s
guns fired, and after showing Syed Ben Seeyd down
into the cabin, where, to my annoyance, the steward
was not to be found, at the request of the sultan—after
apologizing for the absence of the captain—I
showed him and his officers through the ship. He
seemed particularly interested in the examination of
the instruments used in capturing the whale, and paid
great attention to the construction of the boats, asking
many questions through the interpreter, most of
which I left the second mate to answer. When we
returned to the long cabin, the steward had the doors
of the after one thrown open, the decks swept, and
the dead-lights up. After partaking slightly of the
refreshments prepared, and making some inquiry into
the amount of capital invested in the whaling interests
in the United States, the party went into the
after-cabin, where their attention was immediately
fixed on the two ship-models on the transom. While
they were examining these, I tried the doors of the
state-rooms. That on the starboard aftermost side
was locked, the captain, as the steward said, having
the key in his possession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said nothing more at the time, knowing it to be
the one which Mrs. Catherton had formerly occupied,
and the mulatto, by his manner, seemed quite as well
satisfied to be rid of the subject. In a few moments
more, the sultan and his attendants went up on the
poop, when I found the ship decked out in all the
flags she could muster, and the crew rigged in regular
liberty trim. We gave his mightiness nine cheers
and a salute of twenty guns when he left: the last
sight which I saw through the smoke, being the eunuch’s
black face, looming, like a fiend’s, out of the
barge, from under his checked turban.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As soon as the men shifted and turned to again,
I went down into the cabins, when, lo! the doors of
the after one were closed and locked as before. I
thought this a good chance to fall regularly foul of
the steward, when the fellow closed my mouth at
once, by saying in a submissive way, that it was
Captain Catherton’s orders, after his wife’s death,
that the doors should be kept closed. Of course, I
could say no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We went on with our work aloft, and being
strong-handed, after taking in a few sheep and goats,
were ready to go to sea by meridian, when in the
very noon-day glare and piercing heat of the sun, the
Soliman Shah, the Arab corvette, changed her berth
also, finding the little strait too hot for her at last,
with ten deaths on board of her the night previous,
and as many more new cases in her sick bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“However, new life seemed to have inspired our
men. They worked with a will, notwithstanding that
the terrific rays of the sun beaming upon the awnings,
or reflected from a thousand points of the rugged
rocks, made the gap like a gigantic oven. The land-wind
was rising when the captain came off, and the
men, in running up the boats for the night, broke out
into a hearty song, the chorus of which opened the
Arab’s eyes and did one’s soul good to hear, as if the
prospect of getting to sea at last made them set the
blue cholera itself, and all other evils which menaced
the ship, at defiance. There was another meaning
in this, in connection with what I had overheard the
night before, which caused me to look narrowly at
the face of old Charley who started the song, and
those of one or two of the others, to see how far they
were to be trusted, or feared at a pinch; when suddenly
averting my eyes I saw that Catherton, who
stood on the poop, was watching me narrowly,
though he turned away the moment his eyes met
mine, gazing, with a frown on his brow, from the
ship to the frigate, as if something in the clamorous
notes of the men displeased him. It struck me that,
whatever his plans were, carrying it off in this way
must seem natural enough to the Arabs, accustomed
as they were to the ways of English seamen. He
said nothing, however, even after listening attentively
to my report of the Sultan’s visit, turning the
conversation upon the plan for bringing Zuma off to
the ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not doubt but that I should be able to bring her
on board, but I feared that she could not be concealed
should suspicion be directed to the vessel. I had
watched the faces of the sultan and his attendants as
closely as I could, and remarked nothing to alarm
me. Syeed’s demeanor was as mild and gracious as
usual; nevertheless, knowing something of the policy
in the East, I could not divest myself of the thought
that we were watched. Hadji’s black face, with
the wiry mustache and the checked turban over it,
seemed to haunt every dark corner of the ship as the
day waned. Catherton, also, could not entirely conceal
his anxiety. He had been taking his grog freer
than usual for the last two days, and as he was by
no means what is termed a hard drinking man, this
tended, as I thought, to unhinge his faculties in some
degree, and give his cheek an ashy hue foreign to its
natural deep bronze. He smoked incessantly, the
sheroot being never out of his mouth, and his frequent
change of position, when every one else felt
indisposed to stir after the decks were cleared,
showed a degree of restlessness which, under other
circumstances, would have been hard to account for.
I thought it my duty, notwithstanding, to give him
another hint of the danger he was running the ship
into, and choosing my opportunity, accordingly spoke
out pretty plainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I tell you, Captain Catherton,’ said I, ‘you can
have no idea of the means which that accursed
eunuch has of obtaining information. He has spies
every where—perhaps in this very ship, and I know
him too well not to feel certain that, should any of
the ship’s company be found in any way implicated
in the plot, you and I in less than an hour afterward
would be tenants of the same dungeon, with a fair
prospect of being kept prisoners for life, or perhaps
put to death in some diabolical way.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Mr. Miller,’ he answered quietly, ‘I command
this ship. Do you bring the woman off safely, and
I’ll stake my neck on the rest.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And without another word he walked down into
the cabin. This was decided enough, so I remained
standing by the mizzen-rigging, endeavoring to forget
my presentiments of evil by watching the motions
of Muscat Tom, who had been cruising in the
cove all day. By this time, though the sun was
behind the mountains, it wanted still an hour and
more of dark, when the second mate called my attention
to the large flocks of birds flying confusedly
in from the offing and disappearing among the rocks.
A dirty, yellowish cloud suddenly obscured the air,
making it still more oppressive, if possible, and causing
you to wonder if the day was not nearer its end
than you had deemed. The atmosphere was insufferably
hot and oppressive, the little air astir coming
from the land, like the breath of a furnace; you could
see through the stifling gloom that the thin strips of
haze were melting away from the peaks and small
watch-towers in sight from our present berth: a
swell, too, was getting up with the tide, and, presently,
we could hear from seaward a low, indistinct,
appalling sound—which every seaman knows
full well—rising, stealthily, as it were, over the hum
of living voices in the harbor. It was the moan of
the Arabian Sea awakening from its long sleep, and
the swell was the forerunner of the heavy surf
which it sometimes sends in on the rocky coast, before
a severe squall. All at once, as we were noting
these ominous signs, the whale, with a flap of his
flukes that was loudly reverberated by the rocks,
threw half his length clear, and then setting his
stem-propeller and side-paddles in play, commenced
making an offing, slowly at first, but gradually increasing
his speed, until, before he was out of sight,
the water was all in a foam behind him. A moment
after the gloom suddenly deepened, till Parker’s face
at my elbow seemed dusky as an Indian’s—a few
large drops fell upon the awning, and looking aloft
we saw again, over our heads and to the north, the
glaring, vivid blue sky with nothing between, as if
the demon of the storm had flapped his wings at our
mast-head, and then sailed swiftly away, to wreak
his wrath on more defenseless heads. The land-wind,
more like the breath of a flame than a current of
air, coming as it did from the sandy plains of the interior,
was less strong than usual; while the swell
continued to rise with the tide, the water lapping
with a dull splash against the whaleman’s bends,
and the low, aweing, ominous sound still falling upon
the ear at regular intervals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the captain came on deck, while the steward
was setting the table in the cabin, we got our heavy
anchors all ready to let go at a moment’s warning,
and secured our boats inboard, though the Arab frigate
did not appear to take the alarm. In fact, Captain
Catherton did not think it advisable, <span class='it'>under circumstances</span>,
to send down his upper spars, while the
heavy frigate rode to a single anchor, with boats
towing astern, and royal yards across. As for the
corvette, she was hidden in her present berth by
Muscat Island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After supper, the land-wind died entirely away;
the stars came shimmering through the blue ether;
the haze settled about the granite peaks again, and,
with the exception of the low, murmuring sound to
seaward, and the almost imperceptible rise of the
swell, the night bid fair to be as calm as the last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About nine in the evening I went below to get, if
possible, a wink of sleep. I had strong doubts of the
weather, it being now near the time for the setting
in of the dry monsoon, although I thought it probable
that a day or two might pass before it took a decided
change, having seen the same signs prove false tokens
before in this very harbor, the land-wind sometimes
filling the atmosphere with minute particles of
dust, and the whale regularly making a stretch to
sea at sundown for fear of the currents, which here,
of all coasts in the world, are the most shining and
treacherous. The dust-cloud, too, might have driven
the birds to cover sooner than usual, and, in fact, the
only sign to be relied on was the distant moan of the
sea, reaching the ear it was hard to tell how, as
there was not the least flutter of a breeze to be felt.
The tide, too, which rises here about six feet, was
higher than usual, and what with thinking of this,
and of the stories I had heard about the captain, to
say nothing of the heat and the adventure before me
that night, it was long before I fell asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I awoke, I knew, if it were only by the
dull glimmer of the cabin-lamp, and the capers the
rats were cutting along the deck, that it must be
near the hour when Captain Catherton had settled
to call me himself. Looking across the cabin to his
berth I saw that it was empty, and feeling sure that
he was on deck, I again closed my eyes against the
light. However, the mood was past for the time,
and between the smell of the oil, the rats and the
roaches, and the captain, as I supposed, walking the
deck over my head, I found it useless to close an
eyelid. So, gentlemen, I lay wide awake listening
to the tramp above, as of some one in a spell of deep
thought, and watching the pranks of the long-tailed
gentry as they manœuvred around the stands of arms
on the bulkhead, or marched in squads under the
berths; the boldest of them climbing up repeatedly
into the foot of mine, and plumping down again when
I stirred, as if they were bent upon rousing me out
for some end of their own, which, as I afterward
discovered, was for free admission into a cabinet of
marine curiosities, which the mate, who was dead
and gone, had been collecting for some scientific
gentlemen of the Granite state. Where the rats
came from should have been submitted to these same
savants, when, as I heard afterward, they boarded
every ship which come into Bedford Bay for months
after the Tartar was expected home, inquiring after
their curiosity-box, then lying snugly enough at the
bottom of the cove of Muscat.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Aunt</span>,—I have often longed to turn
my pen to the paper, but no one, only the Almighty,
knows how hurried, and bustled, and bothered I am,
getting myself up to understand every thing, <span class='it'>or to
make believe to do so</span>, which comes to much the
same thing for a while anyhow, which I daresay
you don’t understand, and so best for you, Aunt
dear!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m with the lady still, and likely to remain, for
she’s both kind and helpless, and is well enough to
do without a nurse, (she says,) though if I’m not
<span class='it'>that</span> no one ever was. She’s not fractious, poor
dear! only humorsome, and does not care to stay
long in one place—restless-like; I have my trials
with her too in many little ways—I didn’t want her
to know I could read, because she might ask me to
read prayers and things contrary to my religion, but
unfortunately, I said I could write, and that let her
<span class='it'>into it</span>—she was ’cute enough to know that I must
read <span class='it'>first</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were a while in a place, they call it by the
name of Bath; it’s a mighty unnatural city, where
the <span class='it'>could</span> water comes up out of the earth in a continued
boil, and you wouldn’t see a carriage with a
pair of horses in a week’s walk, for it’s the men
are horses there and draw the sick creatures, that
bathe in, and then drink, the hot water, up and down
the hills, and you’d think it a holy place, for every
second gentleman you meet is a priest or a minister;
yes, indeed, they must be a mighty delicate set of
gentlemen in England, for there’s a power of them
in Bath. My mistress never meddles with my religion,
only folds her spectacles in the Bible and
leaves it in my way—but I take no notice. I can
hardly expect you to believe me, but the water
comes as I tell you <span class='it'>hot</span> out of the earth; there must
be a fire under it <span class='it'>somewhere</span>; but who can tell <span class='it'>where</span>
that fire is, or <span class='it'>who</span> looks after it? The inhabitants,
I’m sure, live in greater terror of an explosion than
they <span class='it'>let on</span> to the poor innocents that do be looking
after their health; and maybe that’s the reason they
fill up the town with the Clargy to keep all quiet;
sure it’s them we send for ourselves when any thing
unnatural is going on; if you mind<a id='r10'/><a href='#f10' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[10]</span></sup></a> when the underground
noises were heard in Castle Croft, they
sent for his Reverence Father Joyce at once, and kept
him ever so long about the place, and no one heard a
stir of noise since! so maybe, the holy men are useful
that way in Bath, to keep down the spirits of the
waters in their right place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you my lady was fidgetty-like, and she very
soon got tired of Bath and would come to London.
Now, dear, I’ll leave it to another time to say what
I’ve got to say about London—and remember, sure
if I wrote for a hundred years, I could not <span class='it'>insense</span>
you into what it is, or what it is like. Aunt, it’s
full up of people! underground, overground, high up,
down low—people—people in misery and sin, people
in plenty and pleasure; it’s never still by day or
night, for at night, the very breathing of such thousands
and thousands of people, is like to stifled thunder;
it’s full of a pale withered-up sort of life in one
place, and it is blooming like a fresh May morning
only a stone’s-throw from the same, in another; it’s
a city of contradictions—it’s the grandest place upon
the face of the earth, if it was only for the multitudes
of living immortal creatures it contains, and it’s the
meanest place in the universe:—they make money
out of the very scrapings of the streets!—and, bless
your kind heart! it’s yourself that would be troubled
to see the people driving on, and on, and on forever,
without rest, and all so solid like. And, aunt, but
it’s lonesome to be surrounded by such thousands of
people without knowing one of them from Adam,
only all black strangers, no one to bid you good morrow
morning, or say, God save you; for their manners
are not our manners; they’re a fine, kind-hearted
people, but they’re mortal fearful you should
think so. The first lodging we were in, I thought to
be very kind and mannerly to the mistress of the
house, and so when I met her the next day I dropped
her a curtsey—and says I, ‘The top of the morning
to ye, Ma’am;’ well, instead of returning my civility,
she told my mistress I’d insulted her; you see
they’re an unaccountable people, but it’s not <span class='it'>that</span> I
wanted to write about. Aunt, dear, I know you’re
anxious about how I get on with my ‘<span class='it'>duty</span>’ and I
took your advice and resolved to walk in my own
way, and when I told my mistress I’d like to get
leave to go to my duty, she told me she was well
satisfied with the way I was going on, I was doing
my duty perfectly; so I thanked her for her good
opinion, but said I wanted to make a clean breast, if
I could find out a proper Clergy to make it to; and
then she smiled her faint, quiet smile, just for all the
world like a thread of moonlight, and said, she understood
now that what I meant by ‘duty,’ was going
to the Priest, to confession, and gave me leave
to go next Sunday to first Mass. So I got my instructions
where to go and set off with a light heart.
To be sure it did me good to enter a place of my own
worship again, and the music was just wonderful—only
they made me pay a shilling for a seat, think of
that! but I’d have paid ten, if I had it—to get in, my
heart warmed so. And the tears came to my eyes,
when I see the fine men serving on the altar and such
fine blessed candles—all wax. And the <span class='it'>rale</span> bowing
and turning; and little boys in their little albs that
keeps all the saints’ days, running about the streets,
the darlings, in all sorts and kinds of mischief. Oh,
I was so delighted, and so thankful, and the music
and the velvet, and the painted windys with the sun
shining through them, and the beautiful things, put
me a-past all judgment—if I could have had you there
just to see what a picture it was! But by ’n by, I
heard one of their reverences in the pulpit, though I
was so bewildered I never saw him go there, and I
said to myself, ‘Mass can’t be half over yet,’ think-it
was soon for the <span class='it'>sarmint</span><a id='r11'/><a href='#f11' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[11]</span></sup></a>,—and then I thought
again may be it was the difference of the country,
and looking round I saw all the ladies had crosses on
their Prayer-books, and that set me right again, for I
was sure none but ourselves would have that. Then
the organ and the little boys in their little albs began
again; and I was fairly transported, for never had I
heard such music—not <span class='it'>singing-music</span>, but <span class='it'>talking-music</span>
it was. Oh my heart beat quick with joy, to
think how I had got into the right place, and how in
the very thick of a nation of heretics, there was
every thing natural-like in my own faith. I cried
down tears of joy, and indeed others did the same.
Then another priest—a fine man intirely—got up into
another pulpit, and gave us I must say a fine <span class='it'>sarmint</span>,
I never could desire a better—and it’s the truth I’m
telling you—he spoke of fasts, and saints, and gave
out the services on next saints’ days—and reminded
us of confession. Oh, aunt darling, don’t you or
Father Joyce think bad of it if I say—and it’s thrue
as if they were the last words I should write in this
world—that no holy priest of Rome could pay greater
honor to the saints than himself; or insist finer on
confession and fasts, or bow with more devotion to
the altar; I don’t care who gainsays it, but he was
a fine man. Oh glory! says I, aint I in luck? aint I
blessed? aint I happy? and I thought to myself I’d
make bould to ask a fine grand ould waiting gentleman,
who carried his head high, and was all over
fine: I asked him where I could get spaking with
any of their reverences? and he said some of <span class='it'>the
sisters</span> were in the vestry then, as they were going
to change the <span class='it'>hour of vespers</span>, and, indeed, he <span class='it'>was</span>
mighty civil, and said if I wanted to ask a Christian
question I might wait there, and he took me near the
little room where they keep the vestments, and presently
a fine, grand lady came out, and I heard her
complain how she caught cold <span class='it'>at Matins</span>, and one
of their reverences came out and bid her good day
by the name of ‘<span class='it'>Sister Mary</span>,’ and then the grand
ould waiting gentleman bustled on bowing (not to
the altar, but to the lady), and called out for Lady
Jane Style’s carriage. I had a great mind to call
out ‘Whist,’<a id='r12'/><a href='#f12' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[12]</span></sup></a> for I thought it no way to be shouting
for carriages at the open door of a holy place.
Well; one young priest passed, and another, backing
out and making obadience to their <span class='it'>Shooparier</span>: and
then came two more ladies—‘sisters,’ no doubt, and
then another priest. Oh! how my heart would
have warmed to them, only they seemed somehow
only half way, and at last the <span class='it'>Shooparier</span>
himself came, and I thought any one could see he
was the <span class='it'>rale</span> thing; he was the very stamp and
moral of Father Joyce, and no cardinal could be
more stately—there was a lady, sweet-faced and
gentle-looking with him, but when I fell on my
knees and asked to speak with him she smiled and
went on!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He bid me stand up, and asked what I wanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘To make a clean breast, your reverence, whenever
it’s convanient to you, night or day. Your
time is mine, holy father, and I would not delay you
long, for I’ve kep’ watch over my thoughts and actions;
though, for all that, I’m a <span class='it'>grate</span> sinner.’ I
spoke as <span class='it'>purty</span> as ever I could to the kind gentleman;
well, he asked me if I wanted to be a <span class='it'>sister</span>,
and I said, No—I’d no inclination for a Nunnery,
good or bad; and then, ‘My good girl,’ he says—quite
solid-like, ‘what is it you <span class='it'>do</span> want?’—and
something quare came over me, at the changing of
his countenance; and I makes answer, ‘May be your
reverence would tell me the time for giving it: and
as I like to be prepared and do the thing <span class='it'>dacent</span>,
would your reverence tell me the <span class='it'>charge for absolution</span>
in this town?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, aunt, I put it to you, could any thing be
purtier, or fairer spoken than that? but his white
cheek flushed—he turned on me in anger, only he
could not hould a black look for a minute, and
he says—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Do you take me for one of the blind priests of
Rome?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Indeed I did, sir,’ I made answer, ‘<span class='it'>how could I
help it</span>?’ the words came to my lips quite natural—though
my heart was beating with what I can’t tell,
to think of his speaking that way of the holy fathers,
and he treading as hard as ever he could on their
heels—and then the look of pity he threw on me!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Poor creature, poor creature,’ he says. ‘You
come, I see, of a benighted race.’ Well, I was
bothered. He walked gently on, and the very sweep
of his coat, from head to tail, had a priestly swing
with it; and then he turned back and looked at me
so gently. ‘Have you been often here?’ he says.
Well, I gave him another courtesy, but not so low
as the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No, sir,’ I answered, (I did not ‘your reverence’
him that time,) ‘and I wont trouble you
again.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You do not trouble me,’ he says. ‘I only wish
you trod in our paths.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’d rather keep to my own, sir; and then I’ll
make no mistakes.’ Well, he was a quiet gentleman,
for he smiled at that. And he says again, ‘I
would like to question you a little;’ and he was
going on only I stopt him. ‘Question Father John
Joyce, if you plaze, sir; I’ll give you his address—he
always answered for me, and always will, that’s
my comfort.’ And the name of my own blessed
priest gave me strength. ‘He always answered for
me,’ I repeated, ‘and for my people; he knows what
he’s about, and will scorn to mislead any poor girl—it’s
too bad, so it is, to be situated this way, that I
can’t tell the differ between a holy priest and a protestant
minister.’ Well, that settled him, as I thought
it would; and he walks right away, and the pale
beautiful lady in black, that had been leaning
against a pillar like a <span class='it'>statute</span>, takes his arm; and
the stout goold laced old gentleman beckons me on,
not crossly. So I says, ‘Which of the sisters
is that?’ And he gave a chuckle of a laugh:
‘That’s his <span class='it'>wife</span>,’ he says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Oh! holy Moses,’ says I, ‘look at that now!
<span class='sc'>his wife</span>!’ And I thought of the candles and crosses
and bowings; and all the saints he ran over; and
the little boys in the little albs, and every thing so
like the right—and yet the wrong; ‘his <span class='it'>wife</span>, and
he a <span style='font-size:smaller'>PRIEST</span>! let me out of the place,’ I says, ‘for
it’s a sin and a shame; neither one thing nor another;
all a delusion; let me out;’ and then I stopt. ‘Maybe
he’s not a priest at all!’ I inquired, looking at the
stout old gentleman, ‘and if he’s not, what is he?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’ll tell you, young woman,’ he answers, and he
makes believe to whisper; and then it came on me
like a flash of lightning, that I had got into neither
the one nor the other, but into a <span class='it'>half-way house</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And have you none of them in Ireland?’ he
inquires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, aunty, dear, that bothered me as much as
any thing, how that stout old gentleman knew I was
Irish. I never told him so, and I am as well dressed
as any English maid can be; you would not know
me, (though I was always so nice,) I am so improved;
and yet he says, ‘Have you none of them
in Ireland?’ and I answered quite proudly, ‘<span class='it'>No, sir;
we’ve the rale thing there!</span>’ and that settled <span class='it'>him</span>.
I saw he was ashamed of himself, and of all the
goings on—creeping, creeping toward our holy
church, and yet purtending to talk of its blindness;
yet we ought to be content, for if they’re let to go
on as they’re going, it’s asy told where they’ll
stop; <span class='it'>for the time’s coming</span>, as I heard at Moorfields,
where every thing was to my satisfaction,
and I found the <span class='it'>rale</span> priest at last, though not so fine
a man as our own dear Father Joyce, the heavens
be his bed! and may he and the holy saints keep sin
and heart-sorrow from you, my darling aunt! you
who watched over me with as much as a mother’s
love. It’s the spring-time now, and I often dream
of the Bohreens, and the wild-bird’s song, and then
again I feel as if the whole shadow of the mountain
was over me like a shroud; but it isn’t long that
lasts—as the song says—</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BOOK THIRD.</h2>

<h3>SECTION I.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Again ten circles have passed, and thrice ten circles
of the earth about the sun; and the boy who
proffered grapes, and the infant folded in a mother’s
warm embrace, have grown to manhood. The
young earth, like young life, passed through many a
change in thrice ten years and ten; and, from its
teeming loins sent forth a still increasing multitude
to worship the great First Cause. Upon every hill
an altar smoked; and knowledge, with power to
command the laws to which all matter is subdued,
had not wholly passed from among the sons of men.
Not yet were cities built, nor language confounded,
nor the land parceled out among hostile clans, to be
worried and made desolate; but the herd and the
chase still supplied the simple wants which luxury
has debased. In all the arts of that rude time; to
run; to cleave the briny sea, a strong swimmer; to
throw the spear; to draw the bow, certain of its
mark; to know the signs which divide the day and
fix the watches of the night; to call each tree and
flower, beast and bird, by the name which Adam
gave; the youths were well instructed, and poured
a flood of joy into hearts which marked, from year
to year, their growth in excellence and in strength.</p>

<h3>SECTION II.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The youngest, Ariel, his mother most loved; for
he was mild of temper, and of a make which would
have shamed the Apollo, cut by hands skilled to
search out the hidden springs of manly beauty, and
cunningly transform the ideal into a reality, to stand
forever a wonder before the eyes of men. His
auburn locks, parted on either side, fell thick, and
rested upon his shoulders; and upon his brow, fairer
than woman, sat intellect, softened and refined to
express the hopes and sorrows, the sweet delights
and bitter ills, which God gave a heritage to Adam
and his seed when he drove out the sinning pair
from Paradise. Tall, he stood like a cedar upon
Lebanon. His eyes, large and lustrous, in color his
mother’s and heaven’s, seemed ever dreaming of a
life which, cradled upon earth, had elsewhere its
happiness; and the long brown lashes that veiled
their intenser light, shadowed with melancholy a
face which else had been too bright. In childhood,
he wept over tales of that fair land lost by his first
ancestors; and sought on every side, through the
sombre wood, and along the flowery mead, and up
the streams to their sources amid the valleys of the
hills, for some trace of a glory half-extinct which
might lead him onward to its walls, guarded by
flame; then, weary and sad, he would stand by the
sea, and look out across its waters, and strain his
eyes to find a new earth, and catch a glimpse of that
strange fire which, under the rule of night, mellows
the waves, and makes their path more enticing than
the walks of Arcady the blest, or the garden in which
Italia’s poet subdued Ruggerio to a witch’s love.
Thus found by his mother, after long search, he
would rest his head upon her knees, and repeat his
hopes and disappointments, while she, softly chiding,
wiped his tears away. Growing toward manhood,
he, unwillingly and slow, now doubting and now believing,
put off his childish faith, and sought for
and found a rest more perfect, and more noble far,
than that paradise which fled before the knowledge
of evil and of good.</p>

<h3>SECTION III.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Tubal, the eldest born, was mightier than his brother.
Less tall, strong, he stood like Hercules leaning
on his club. His lusty shoulders seemed made
to bear the weight of any ill which time and the first
sin might engender to crush the sons of Adam; and
his foot was firmer than the rock. Within his broad
breast, capacious, the wildest passions, love and
hate, and jealousy and ambition, raged and crouched
obedient to a will which held them bound, nor
loosed its hold but to fulfill its purpose. His hair
curled close, nor played in dalliance with the wanton
air. His eyes, blacker than the night which
covered Egypt when the chosen were oppressed,
burned fierce; and within their depths lay hidden
cunning, and power, and the determination to complete
what cunning prompts and power may well
perform. His nostrils swelled with triumphs not
yet won; and on his lips, compressed, and on his
swarthy brow, courage had stamped its signet. He
loved the chase, and the boar pursued beyond the
mountains which barred his father’s steps, and rose
a barrier never passed till he burst through to conquer
new fields, boundless, and rich in all the wealth
of his rude life. Action was his rest; and to him
plain fact was beautiful enough, nor sought he, in
vain imaginings, to work out of strong matter kindred
unto himself, forms of excellence which live
only in a poet’s brain, to curse the possessor. His
father loved him, for when a boy he drew his father’s
bow, and threw his father’s spear, laughed at fatigue,
and scorned the pleasures of quiet contemplation
which, with his brother, stole half the days away.
In him was small obedience, even from his birth;
self-willed, he threw off his mother’s hand as a steed
of high mettle, untamed, flings at the bit; and thus
he grew, a Titan in his passions as a Titan in his
make.</p>

<h3>SECTION IV.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The morn had ushered in a new year, when Tubal
and his brother went forth to worship upon the
neighboring mountains, and offer up a sacrifice in
acknowledgment of mercies past, of mercies present,
and of mercies yet to come. From the sea a
mist rolled inward, and covered all the land, and
covered the forest wide, and crept up the hill-sides,
and hung about their tops, and curled over, descending
like a glory, to be lost in the space beyond.
Bathed in cloud, seeing their path dimly, they
walked hand in hand, loaded with gifts of the chase,
and of the vine, and pure water, and sweet-scented
wood. Ariel found a new beauty in the thick vapor
which shut out the heavens, and so stilled the song
of the trees that, listening, he believed he could hear
the very mist singing, as it moved onward upon its
errand of fruitfulness and health; but Tubal saw
power, and felt his strength grow within him, and,
invigorated, stood erect, and trod more proudly the
earth which he claimed as his own. As they ascended
the higher grounds, and climbed the steeps
which led upward to the temple they had chosen,
the cloud grew thinner, and the light increased, and
they halted, silent, and bowed their heads, and
pressed their lips to the mountain-side, and kissed
God’s foot-prints—there seen, clear and radiant, as
they are now to be seen impressed, eternal, upon the
granite which, in the far North, lifts its head a mark
to the returning mariner, who—far out upon the
ocean—hails the beacon with all the joy of home.
Then rising, they mounted quickly to the summit,
round, and fair with its own flood, and standing,
gazed. Gazed upon the cloud spread out beneath
their feet, a vast expanse of silver water, covering
land and sea; gazed upon the hill-tops which rose
above the flood, as isles sleeping upon the bosom of
a quiet lake; gazed upon the heavens, serenely blue,
over-arching all; and gazed upon the sun, red and
huge, struggling with the mist, till its rays, released,
flashed upon the isles, and lighted up the heavens,
and so wrought that the deep cloud, mastered by
their heat, broke from its fastenings, and rolled in
masses, and, rifted, opened cavernous, and showed,
first the crowning tufts of the forest-trees, and then
the lower boughs, and then the plain, reeking with
moisture, and then the sea, bright and dancing,
until the last wreath of feathery vapor ascending,
vanished.</p>

<h3>SECTION V.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>“For this, it is enough to have lived; thy works,
O God, are wondrous fair!” said Ariel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tubal, turned away, silent; and casting his offerings
upon the ground, threw up the heavy sward in
piles high and broad, which he fashioned into a rude
altar; then covering it thick with wood, found near
at hand, he called unto his brother, and together they
laid upon it the chase, the grapes, and the branches
sweet-scented and laving, prayed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We thank thee, Father, for thy mercies past,
thy mercies present, and thy mercies yet to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank thee for strength,” said Tubal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank thee for the comeliness of this earth,”
said Ariel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me power to rule my fellow-men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me knowledge to win thy love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me honor, and obedience, with fear—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me humility, and trust, with faith—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>—“and may my will be a law unto many.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>—“and may my walk be good in thy sight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, I thank thee for these limbs; this body,
so perfect in its make—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, I thank thee for this life, so full of all
excellence—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>—“clothe it with majesty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>—“clothe it with purity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grant that I may live in the speech of generations
far removed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grant that I may live in the hearts of generations
far removed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless, O God, my purpose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless, O God, my father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strengthen, O God, my hands”—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strengthen, O God, my mother”—</p>

<p class='pindent'>—“so that they may well perform what thou hast
given them to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>—“so that she may well perform what thou hast
given her to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And accept, O God, these gifts, the fruit of thy
bounty, by us acknowledged and adored.”</p>

<h3>SECTION VI.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the brothers, thus ending, a light, greater
than the sun, fell suddenly and smote them blind;
and as they lay, prostrate with excessive dread, they
heard a voice, soft as the movement of a gentle wind,
saying, “Even as ye have asked, ye shall receive;”
and then came silence, and darkness with the light
of day; and slowly rising, fearful, they found the
altar, with its gifts, all consumed. And where the
altar stood, a glowing pool of metal burned, and
hissed, and bubbled, and ran down the hill-side a
thread of fire. Tubal, curious, doubting, with cautious
step drew near; and as the metal cooled, and
changed from white to red, from red to black, observed
it narrowly, and beat upon it, and found it
malleable, and broke it, and took it in his hands still
warm, and held it out in triumph to his brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the birth of iron; and in the air, above,
beneath, on either side, far off and near, came music,
and the brothers listened, mute with wonder, to a
song prophetic of the metal and its uses.</p>

<h3>SECTION VII.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Clink, clank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crackling of flame, playing with the air that
fanned it, swept past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Glowing, flashing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not speech, but sounds inarticulate, in strains wild,
sturdy and noble as their subject, filled the ears of
Ariel and his brother, to be interpreted as we interpret
the voices of matter, miscalled dumb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clashing, clanging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there was a rushing to and fro of many feet,
while the furnace roared with a pouring as of breath
in hot haste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bubble, bubble—muffled, dull and deep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The anvil rings, and blow on blow is given.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sharp and quick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the forging, and the grinding, and the filing,
and the whetting, with the shock of blade on blade,
till the clatter of that smithy, mingling and dividing,
mellowed, rose sweeter than the notes fabled of the
sun, when he with his first rays smote upon the head
of Memnon in wonder-loving Egypt; or the song
heard by the wandering Greek hard by Charibdis,
enticing the listening mariner to his death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aha! aha! thou hast found a new life, and a new
action, greatest of metals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who are ye, who thus welcome me with a hymn
of glory?</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are the light, the eldest born, begotten in love,
in love to endure forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were present at thy beginning, and saw the
hand which moulded thee with fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We saw the joy of thy young days, and acknowledge
thee a child of God, like unto ourselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We know thy offices, and the laws which rule
thee, liquid or congealed, obedient to God’s will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the depths of the earth wert thou engendered,
and didst dwell in darkness for this hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the center didst thou spring upward, and
wert poured through all the veins of matter, to
strengthen and complete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now thou art born into a new life, and art appointed
to build and destroy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another, mightier than thyself, shall shape thee,
and thou shall be his bondsman until thy work is
done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the furnace and at the forge shall thy true worth
be tried, and every good by heaven blessed, by thee
be multiplied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then sing the praise of iron; the sturdy and noble
iron—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clink, clank;</p>

<p class='pindent'>Glowing, flashing;</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clanging, clashing;</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sharp and quick;</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the grinding, and the filing, and the whetting,
and the shock of blade on blade; while the clatter
of the smithy ringing, cries, it is mine to civilize.</p>

<h3>SECTION VIII.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The brothers hastened from the mount, and descending,
bore homeward the new-found metal with
dances, and with shouts, which called Erix and
Zella to meet them, and to listen, with growing eyes
and a faith equal to their own, to the marvelous tale
of the light which fell from heaven, and their blindness
and the voice within them, and the altar burned,
and the molten pool, and the strange wild music
which they heard, until a knowledge entered into
them of the gift they had received.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, my prayer is answered,” said Tubal,
and quick, to make his knowledge sure, the four
built up the first rude forge, and piled it high with
wood, and put fire to it, and, as it burned, cast in
the metal, which they watched until it reddened and
flashed, coruscating. Then Tubal drew the metal
forth, and beat it between two stones, and flattened
it, and, twisting, gave it ever new forms, while
Erix, with Ariel and his mother, stood admiring,
and reasoned of its uses. And thus did Tubal work
with cunning and with strength, from day to day,
until he had won the skill to fashion the metal to
his will; to arm his arrows and his spear, and devise
new weapons for the chase. He soon found
out the way of beating iron upon itself, nor lacked
the wit of many inventions to aid his labor; and the
ponderous sledge wielded by his arms, black with
soot, from morn to eve resounded along the heaving
sea, which knew no heavier din when, long after,
Vulcan forged beneath Ætna. His tribe stood around
him thick, and wondered at his work, and learned
of him; and when, as time rolled on, the elders told
his story to their sons, they called him the father of
all who worked in metal.</p>

<h3>SECTION IX</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Ariel went dreaming on his way; nor sought to
rival his brother at the forge, nor questioned the
right which he assumed to rule among his fellow-men.
He acknowledged his brother’s worth, and
knew him to be the completest man to meet the
stern necessities of life—to lay deeply in that new
age a strong foundation upon which others were to
build, for good or ill, through many a revolving year,
the politics of the earth. To himself it was given
to see the future in its action; and it passed before
him so distinct and bright, that Zella, sitting at his
side, oft turned away with fear, as his tongue grew
eloquent over a tale of greatness and of sorrow still
hidden within the womb of time. Thrice blessed is
he who knows his work and does it; who learns in
early youth that the practical is the only good, nor
chases phantoms, till, the harvest past, he turns a
poor gleaner upon another’s steps, and begs from
bounty what should be his of right. But Ariel had
other hopes, not willed, but given for a purpose, to
which he was bound as the winged chorister is
bound to the melody which springs unbidden from
its throat. He lived in the ideal, and strove to grasp
the mysterious laws by which the world within acts
upon the world without. The soul’s own greatness
to all of God’s labor a greatness gives, which lesser
spirits never know; and the soul’s beauty is poured
upon all matter, as the setting sun, in ripe October,
pours a purple flood of departing light upon the gorgeous
landscapes of my native North. This Ariel
knew; and when he listened to the voices of the
sea, of the wood, and of the lesser herbage, growing;
to the sighing of the air, and the creaking, and the
grating of bough on bough, rocked by the wind; he
believed that all were parts of one great hymn, whose
interpreter was within, and, combined, would a language
give more perfect to express the soul’s griefs
and joys, the loveliness and magnitude of God’s
labors, than that which Adam, articulate, invented.</p>

<h3>SECTION X.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Thus Ariel mused, and in his walks under the
silent moon, watched close, to catch the notes which
rose from every point of earth; and sitting with his
mother, to whom he opened his whole heart, talked
of this wisdom. And thus, one quiet eve, when the
star which ushers in and leads off day’s hours, then
called God’s love, now changed to the queen in
Paphos worshiped, was just dipping beneath the
western hills, and the wind slow rising set outward
to the sea, these two, the mother and the son, went
forth to drink new draughts of the knowledge he
had found, and kept hidden from all else save her
whose soul was like unto his own. She leaned upon
his shoulder as a loved support, and they passed,
mingling in sweet converse, along the wooded paths
to the stream which flowed noiseless, and now dark
beneath the forest shades, close by the bank upon
which she had rested from the chase, and with Erix
recounted the endless good with which heaven had
blessed the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This water, so silent, yet speaks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In sadness,” said Zella.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the day and for the night it has a several
voice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And does the sorrow which comes to us, a heritage
of Eden, fall also here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother, the star now hidden behind the western
hills, its sister orbs, this earth, this wood, and water
running, all speak to the soul according to its wisdom.
Has sadness no beauty; grief no love? As
darkness follows light, so joy and sorrow interchange,
to make life perfect. This marvel of our God, in
which strength and weakness strive to one end,
were incomplete, did not thy tears, like fallen rain
glittering in the sun, give brightness to the smile
that hastens to drive thy tears away. In matter is
to be found the sure interpreter of God’s will, and
the purpose for which he made such excellence of
earth and sky, with man, the chiefest excellence of
all; and I watch to catch the secret which unlocks
this knowledge, and will give to me, and to thee,
my mother, the fullness of that glory which in the
beginning was breathed into Adam, a living soul!”</p>

<h3>SECTION XI.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke the wind sighed deeply along the
silent stream, and the reeds there growing upon its
sedgy bank gave forth sounds multitudinous, separate
and commingled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“List, mother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The symphony, at first low, scarce audible, dying,
sprang to life again, and rose in notes æolic, flooding
the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is this, mother, this that I would win; the
common language of every created thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are the wind, whistling, piping, sounds melodious
in the ear of night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there was a rustling as of forest leaves; and
a murmuring, as of water running; while from the
reedy grass came other voices,</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shrill and clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are they with whom God wrought, in his six
days of labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the swelling, round and full,</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sliding, springing,</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning, beating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Streams of pleasure,</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without measure,</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the movement quick and pure,</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now increasing,</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now diminishing,</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now combining,</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now resolving,</p>

<p class='pindent'>In sweet concord antiphonal, said that they were
harmony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My prayer is answered, mother; for I have found
the bond which binds heart to heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Zella laid her head upon Ariel’s bosom, and in
very gladness, wept; and confessed that life and death,
her evil and her good, no longer were a mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are the law by which all things live, and
move, and have their being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Ariel put out his hands, and plucked, and
blew upon the reeds; and again the wind sighed
along the silent stream; and again the grass there
growing, waving, gave forth other sounds;</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brighter,</p>

<p class='pindent'>Higher,</p>

<p class='pindent'>More ecstatic;</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fiercer, fiercer, fiercer yet;</p>

<p class='pindent'>As if a Titan had strung his lyre to a new creation,
or the fingers of a god swept the strings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is finished; and to man is given the art to rule
the airs of heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They turned, while yet the sledge fell heavy by the
beating sea, and Erix wound a horn of joy, calling,
then wound, then called, and wound and called again,
and the echoes answered, calling;</p>

<div><h1><a id='arab'></a>THE ARABS AT AMBOISE.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>On the right bank of the Loire, close to one of the
stations of the rail-road from Orleans to Nantes,
which transports the traveler in a few hours from
the centre of civilised France to the heart of Brittany,
and all its wild traditions and druidical mysteries,
stands an ancient and time-honored town—important
in the history both of France and England,
during a series of centuries—a town beloved of Anne
of Brittany and of Mary Stuart, the scene of stirring
and romantic adventures without number, all of
which have paled before the interest it has excited
of late years as the place of captivity of a great chief,
and, within a few weeks, as forming a rich part of
that spoil which the immense possessions of the
house of Orleans is likely to furnish to the present
ruler of the French nation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tourists on the Loire know the charming town
of Amboise very well; and none ever missed, in
days of yore, visiting its fine castle, whose high
walls are bathed by the noble river. This pleasure
has, however, long been denied them, for the captive
whose misfortunes have excited so much sympathy
throughout Europe, and whose “hope deferred” is
still destined to “make his heart sick,” the ill-fated
Abd-’el-Kader, with his followers, are still detained
there, and likely so to be, in spite of the “<span class='it'>I would
if I could</span>” of his supposed struggling friend, the
nephew of another great prisoner of days gone by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amboise, a few years since, was a smiling, lively
little town, and the castle was a pleasure-residence
of the last king; the gardens were delicious, the little
chapel of St. Hubert a gem, restored in all its lustre,
and the glory of artists and amateurs. All is now
changed: a gloom has fallen on the scene, the flowers
are faded, the gates are closed, the pretty pavilions
are shut up; there are guards instead of gardeners,
and a dreary prison frowns over the reflecting waters,
which glide mournfully past its towers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If you pause awhile on the bridge of Amboise, and
look up to the windows of the castle, you may, perhaps,
see one or other of the captives seated sadly
and motionlessly, or it may be slowly pacing along a
high gallery which runs from tower to tower, but it
is rare at present that the dispirited inhabitants of
those dismal chambers have energy to seek even
such recreation as this, and the traveler may drive
through Amboise twenty times, without having his
curiosity to see Lord Londonderry’s <span class='it'>protégé</span> gratified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The writer of these pages happened to be in the
neighborhood when Abd-’el-Kader was transferred
from Pau, the birth-place of Henri Quatre, in the
Pyrenees, to this once gay château on the Loire,
and was amongst those who witnessed the arrival
of the party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evening was very chilly and misty, and but
few persons had been tempted to linger late by the
river side; the attention, however, of those who had
not yet “betaken them home,” was attracted by a
steamboat full of passengers, coming from Paimbeuf,
which stopped beneath the walls of the castle, and
gave a signal apparently understood by a guard of
soldiers, which had been loitering on the shore. The
arrival of the steamer was immediately communicated
to the governor of the castle, and much unwonted
movement ensued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A rumor of something remarkable soon spread
throughout the town, and a concourse of people came
hurrying over the bridge, in order to be present at
the expected landing of prisoners of importance.
There was no attempt to repress this curiosity, for
no rescue was evidently feared; a double line of
soldiers was, however, formed, and in silence and
gloom a sad procession was soon formed of no less
than eighty-two individuals, men, women and children,
all covered with large mantles of white wool,
of a fashion unseen in this part of the world since
the great Saracen warrior Abd’eraman was driven
back from Touraine by Charles Martel; the strangers
thus attired took their way from the sandy shore of
the Loire to the precipitous ascent of the dark towers
before them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These captives were the Arab chief Abd-’el-Kader,
his mother, one of his brothers-in-law, his uncle,
a patriarch of ninety, whose long, white beard fell to
his girdle, and four of his wives. Following them
came a train of attendants, all prisoners, and all sharing
their master’s sorrows and mischances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heavy gateway closed upon the new guests,
and the inhabitants of Amboise, somewhat awe-struck
and impressed with pity, returned mournfully
to their respective domiciles, no doubt thanking
Heaven that they were denizens of free and happy
France, generous, valiant, honorable and victorious!—alas,
how long to remain so!</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that time a new amusement was provided
for the pleasure-loving natives of the pretty but
dreary old town, which still wears the characteristics
of the past in its acutely pointed roofs, crowned
with quaint belfrys, its arches spanning the streets,
its antique chapel of St. Florentin, its <span class='it'>palais de justice</span>
transformed into a barrack, and its little Château
du Clos-Lucet, where, tradition says, Leonardo da
Vinci, the great painter, passed the last years of his
long life, and where he died.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many a summer evening was henceforth spent by
the citizens on the bridge, their pastime being to
gaze curiously up toward the walls and windows of
the castle; for, wandering along the terraces, which
hang in mid air, might then be frequently seen, like
a gliding spectre, the majestic form of an Arab,
wrapped in a white <span class='it'>burnous</span>, with solemn steps
pacing to and fro, unobservant and indifferent to the
curiosity which he excited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Compassion for these unfortunate strangers suggested,
even amongst those in whose charge their
safety was placed, alleviations to their griefs. The
Arab servants of the chief were allowed to seek provisions
for their repasts in the town itself, accompanied
merely by a soldier, who did not molest them.
All who applied for permission to behold Abd-’el-Kader
were admitted to the castle precincts, and
were introduced to his presence. At first he probably
felt amused at the novelty of this proceeding, but
at length he became annoyed at the persevering curiosity
which left him no leisure for reflections, however
doleful. His spirits, too, in the course of long
months of hopeless anxiety, gave way, and he at
length refused to be exhibited as a caged lion, to
make sport to the inquisitive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not alone in the early stage of his captivity, but
ever since he became their neighbor, the ladies of
Amboise, with continuous kindness, showed their
benevolent feeling both to him and to the females of
his suite and their children. Delicacies from their
kitchens, and little useful presents <a id='were'></a>were showered
upon the poor captives, who received the attentions
in the spirit in which they were given.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One instance of consideration gave particular gratification
to the Emir. Madame de Villeneuve, the
<span class='it'>châtellaine</span> of Catherine de Medicis’ lovely castle of
Chenonceau, so well-known to tourists, and so often
described, sent Abd-’el-Kader a magnificent plant, a
native of his own valleys of the Atlas. It is related
that the Emir on receiving it burst into tears. He
sent back the expression of his gratitude in the following
characteristically poetical words:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too poor to offer you in return any thing worthy
of your acceptance, not possessing even a flower
that I can call mine, I will pray to Allah that for the
love of his servant he will one day bestow Paradise
upon you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some time after this, the health of the Emir having
suffered from confinement, he was allowed to
ride on horseback in the neighborhood of Amboise,
and the first excursion which he made was to the
Château of Chenonceau, where his presence, no
doubt,</p>

<p class='line0'>“Made a little holyday,”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And his visit has added another <span class='it'>souvenir</span> to the list
of those illustrious and interesting personages who
have made the romantic retreat of Diana of Poitiers
and her rival famous for all time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abd-’el-Kader used often to be seen at his devotions
at the rising and setting of the sun. He is
accustomed to prostrate himself in an angle of that
very iron balcony from whence, in the days of the
Medici, the conspirators of Amboise were hung as
a public example to traitors. Leaning against the
stone wall, he remains absorbed in his orisons, and
tells his beads with the fervor of a prisoner and an
exile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The numerous portraits of him to be seen in Paris,
particularly popular since Lord Londonderry’s letters
have made his fine, melancholy, majestic face
familiar to the world. He is little more than forty-five,
and has a countenance which, but that Eastern
countenances deceive, one would feel inclined not
only to admire, but to trust. It is hard to say whether
the French would do right to confide in it, but
certain it is that he is the object of deep admiration.
His large, mournful, gazelle eyes, his calm, beautiful
mouth, and his rich, jet-black beard, have gained
many a heart, both male and female; but his misfortunes
are too interesting, too romantic, too <span class='it'>piquants</span>
to be lightly parted with, and the French
will probably keep the lion still caged as an object
on which to exercise their sensibilities, unless indeed,
the dispossessed owners of Amboise should
take his place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes the Emir would appear on his balcony
accompanied by the ladies of his suite. One of them
is said to be still young and very handsome. This
is the report of a young Frenchman, whose patient
curiosity was rewarded on a happy occasion, when
the veiled fair one withdrew the envious screen of
her beauties one day, imagining that she was unobserved,
that she might the better gaze upon the fine
river, and feel the soft breeze of an evening in June
upon her cheek. Occasionally some of the children
of the captives may be seen playing round their parents,
as they stand motionless, looking from their
high position. These little captives are of all shades,
from white to ebony hue, and are by no means so
silent or so still as their elders, for they clamor and
climb and twist about upon the parapets in a manner
quite startling to those who are watching them from
below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some time ago the Bishop of Algiers, passing
through Amboise, stopped to pay a visit to the
Emir; he exhorted him to resignation—alas! what
else could he preach?—and received the same answer
as the illustrious prisoner always gives to those
who seek to console him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I gave myself up on the sole condition that I
should be conducted to Alexandria, in order to go to
Mecca, where I desired to finish my days. The
promise was given me: I ask for nothing further
and I rely on the justice of Allah.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bishop said prayers in the exquisite little
chapel of the castle already mentioned, as so beautifully
restored by the unfortunate Louis Philippe,
and which is in itself the most perfect specimen of
art ever beheld, with its marble pictures of St.
Hubert’s miracle, its elaborate doorways and vivid
glass painting, rivaling the antique. A pretty little
sentimental service was got up, of which the Arab
captives were made the heroes, numerous prayers
being addressed to Heaven for their welfare, both
of body and soul. Probably the prisoners really felt
grateful for the attention, even though neither the
priest nor the shrine had relation to their own
belief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the suite, the oftenest seen in Amboise,
was the butcher, Ben Salem, who officiated for his
tribe, and whose office was looked upon as a solemn
one. He had a fine muscular figure, with an intelligent
and handsome face, and was upward of six
feet high. When he immolated an animal he might
be said, as has been apocryphally reported of Shakspeare,
to have</p>

          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Done it in high style, and made a speech.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>About a year and a half ago poor Ben-Salem was
found a drowned corpse, in the Loire; he is supposed
to have perished while bathing, but the writer
recollects at the time, to have heard it whispered
that despair had caused him to commit suicide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attachment of the Arabs to their chief is
intense; an instance of this excited immense interest
in Paris some time since. A young man who had
belonged to Abd-’el-Kader, was detained at Toulon,
from whence he escaped, but instead of endeavoring
to regain his own country, his sole desire was to
behold his chief once more, and to die at his feet.
He arrived at Amboise, no one knew how, having
traversed France to its centre, and there, his clothes
in tatters, his feet bleeding, and fainting with hunger
and fatigue, he was overtaken, secured, and forced
back again to his prison at Toulon, without having
gained the object of so much energy and resolution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How could the most severe guardians of the safety
of France drive back such a servant from his master?</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the month of August, 1850, a party of the Arabs
received permission to return to Africa. After extraordinary
struggles between their love of country
and of their master, forty men, women, and children,
consented to profit by this clemency. Their parting
was, however, a scene of desolation, agonizing to
witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The railroad was to take back these sons and
daughters of the Desert partly on their way, and a
carriage filled with pale emaciated women, holding
their children in the folds of their ample garments,
bore them from the castle walls. The men pursued
their journey on foot, a cart containing their wretched
goods followed, and the patriarch of the tribe accompanied
them to the station, where he took leave of
them with sighs, tears, and exhortations, mixed
with embraces. At the last moment a young woman,
who was probably related to the patriarch,
lost her presence of mind entirely—her veil thrown
back in despair, she cast herself upon his bosom,
concealing her face in his venerable white beard, and
uttering cries that melted the hearts of the bystanders
to hear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One feature of this parting was remarkable; a
young peasant woman of Amboise had been the wet-nurse
of a little Arab child, and was now to take leave
of the helpless infant whom she had tended till, from
a half dying plant, it had become strong and healthy,
and full of life. For more than a quarter of an hour
the mother of the babe and its nurse remained in an
agony of grief, mutually embracing and consoling
each other, while the innocent object of their care
wept for company. At length the poor sobbing
Frenchwoman tore herself away, and the train
moved off bearing away forever her cherished nurseling
and its grateful but sorrowing parents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many of the children in Abd-’el-Kader’s suit died
soon after their arrival, and the influence of the moist
climate on all the attendants was felt severely by
persons accustomed to go half clothed and with
naked feet. The sisters of charity of Amboise and
the medical men had many mournful scenes to go
through, as the little Arab burial-ground, near the
“Gate of Lions” of the castle, attests but too
clearly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The health of the Emir himself has, it is said, of
late given way, and he has had to deplore the loss
of several of its nearest friends. The tenderness
and feeling shown to these <span class='it'>conquered enemies</span>,
proves, it must be confessed, that there is no want
of kindliness in the hearts of at least the <span class='it'>country
people</span> of France, whose impulses are generally for
good, as we have every reason to acknowledge in
the charitable promptitude and active benevolence
shown to the unfortunate survivors of the Amazon,
by the whole of the inhabitants of Brest from the
highest to the lowest.</p>

<div><h1><a id='cam'></a>ARAB AND CAMANCHEE HORSEMEN.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The admirable skill of the South Americans as
horsemen is everywhere acknowledged, and has been
described by many writers; the following account,
however, by Mr. Darwin, is so truthful and spirited,
that it conveys the best idea of their exploits:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One evening a ‘domidor’ (subduer of horses)
came for the purpose of breaking in some colts. I
will describe the preparatory steps, for I believe they
have not been mentioned by other travelers. A troop
of wild young horses is driven into the corral or large
inclosure of stakes, and the door is shut. We will
suppose that one man alone has to catch and mount
a horse which as yet had never felt bridle or saddle.
I conceive, except by a Guacho, such a feat would
be utterly impracticable. The Guacho picks out a
full-grown colt; and as the beast rushes round the
circus, he throws his lasso so as to catch both the
front legs. Instantly the horse rolls over with a
heavy shock, and whilst struggling on the ground
the Guacho, holding the lasso tight, makes a circle
so as to catch one of the hind legs just beneath the
fetlock, and draws it close to the two front. He then
hitches the lasso, so that the three legs are bound
together; then sitting on the horse’s neck, he fixes a
strong bridle, without a bit, to the lower jaw. This
he does by passing a narrow thong through the eye-holes
at the end of the reins, and several times round
both jaw and tongue. The two front legs are now
tied closely together with a strong leathern thong,
fastened by a slip-knot, the lasso which bound the
three together being then loosed, the horse rises with
difficulty. The Guacho, now holding fast the bridle
fixed to the lower jaw, leads the horse outside the
corral. If a second man is present—otherwise the
trouble is much greater—he holds the animal’s head
whilst the first puts on the horse-cloths and saddle and
girths, the whole together. During this operation,
the horse, from dread and astonishment at being thus
bound round the waist, throws himself over and over
again on the ground, and till beaten is unwilling to
rise. At last, when the saddling is finished, the poor
animal can hardly breathe from fear, and is white
with foam and sweat. The man now prepares to
mount by pressing heavily on the stirrup, so that the
horse may not lose its balance; and at the moment
he throws his leg over the animal’s back he pulls the
slip-knot and the beast is free. The horse, wild with
dread, gives a few most violent bounds, and then
starts off at full gallop. When quite exhausted, the
man by patience brings him back to the corral, where,
reeking hot and scarcely alive, the poor beast is let
free. Those animals which will not gallop away,
but obstinately throw themselves on the ground, are
by far the most troublesome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Chili, a horse is not considered perfectly broken
till he can be brought up standing in the midst
of his full speed on any particular spot; for instance,
on a cloak thrown on the ground; or again, will
charge a wall and, rearing, scrape the surface with
his hoofs. I have seen an animal bounding with
spirit, yet merely reined by a fore-finger and thumb,
taken at full gallop across a court-yard, and then
made to wheel round the post of a veranda with
great speed, but at so equal a distance that the rider
with outstretched arm, all the while kept one finger
rubbing the post, then making a <span class='it'>demi-volte</span> in the air
with the other arm outstretched in a like manner, he
wheeled round with astonishing force in the opposite
direction. Such a horse is well-broken; and although
this at first may appear useless, it is far otherwise.
It is only carrying that which is daily necessary
into perfection. When a bullock is checked
and caught by the lasso, it will sometimes gallop
round and round in a circle, and the horse being
alarmed at the great strain, if not well broken, will
not readily turn like the pivot of a wheel. In consequence
many men have been killed; for if a lasso
once takes a twist round a man’s body, it will instantly,
from the power of the two animals, almost
cut him in twain. On the same principle the races
are managed. The course is only two or three hundred
yards long, the desideratum being, to have horses
that can make a rapid dash. The race-horses are
trained not only to stand with their hoofs touching a
line, but to draw all four feet together, so as at the
first spring to bring into play the full action of the
hind quarters. In Chili I was told an anecdote,
which I believe was true, and it offers a good illustration
of the use of a well-broken animal. A respectable
man riding one day met two others, one of
whom was mounted on a horse, which he knew to
have been stolen from himself. He challenged them;
they answered by drawing their sabres and giving
chase. The man on his good and fleet beast kept
just ahead; as he passed a thick bush he wheeled
round it, and brought up his horse to a dead check.
The pursuers were obliged to shoot on one side and
ahead. Then instantly dashing on right behind them,
he buried his knife in the back of one, wounded the
other, recovered his horse from the dying robber, and
rode home.” Animals are so abundant in these
countries that humanity is scarcely known. Mr.
Darwin was one day riding in the Pampas with a
very respectable “Estanciero,” when his horse being
tired, lagged behind. The man often shouted to him
to spur him, when Mr. D. remonstrated that it was
a pity, for the horse was quite exhausted, he cried:
“Why not?—never mind. Spur him—it is <span class='it'>my</span>
horse!” When, after some difficulty, he was made
to understand that it was for the horse’s sake that the
spurs were not used, he exclaimed with great surprise:
“Ah! Don Carlos <span class='it'>qui cosa</span>!” The idea had
never before entered his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this country the powers of horses in swimming
are but little tested, but in South America the case
is different, as shown by an incident mentioned by
Mr. Darwin. “I have crossed the Lucia near its
mouth, and was surprised to observe how easily our
horses, although not used to swim, passed over a
width of at least six hundred yards. On mentioning
this at Monteo Video, I was told that a vessel containing
some mountebanks and their horses being
wrecked in the Plata, one horse swam seven miles
to the shore. In the course of the day I was amused
by the dexterity with which a Guacho forced a restive
horse to swim a river. He stripped off his
clothes and jumped on its back, rode into the water
till it was out of its depth; then slipping off the
crupper he caught hold of the tail, and as often as the
horse turned round, the man frightened it back by
splashing water in its face. As soon as the horse
touched the bottom on the other side the man pulled
himself on, and was firmly seated, bridle in hand, before
the horse gained the bank. A naked man on a
naked horse is a fine spectacle. I had no idea how
well the two animals suited each other. The tail of
a horse is a very useful appendage. I have passed
a river in a boat, with four people in it, which was
ferried across in the same way as the Guacho. If a
man and horse have to cross a broad river, the best
plan is for the man to catch hold of the pommel or
mane, and help himself with the other arm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Turkoman horses are most highly prized in
Persia, and are regularly trained by the Turkomans
preparatory to their plundering expeditions. Before
proceeding on a foray, these wild people knead a
number of small hard balls of barley-meal, which,
when wanted, they soak in water, and which serves
as food both for themselves and their horses. It is
a frequent practice with them in crossing deserts
where no water is to be found, to open a vein in the
shoulder of the horse and drink a little of his blood,
which, according to their own opinion, benefits rather
than injures the animal. It is confidently stated, that
when in condition, their horses have gone one hundred
and forty miles within twenty-four hours; and
it has been proved that parties of them were in the
habit of marching from seventy to one hundred and
five miles for twelve or fifteen days together without
a halt. During Sir John Malcolm’s first mission to
Persia, he, when riding one day near a small encampment
of Afshar families, expressed doubts to his
Mehmander, a Persian nobleman, as to the reputed
boldness and skill in horsemanship of their females.
The Mehmander immediately called to a young
woman of handsome appearance, and asked her, in
Turkish, if she was a soldier’s daughter. She said
she was. “And you expect to be a mother of soldiers?”
She smiled. “Mount that horse,” said he,
pointing to one with a bridle, but without a saddle;
“and show this European Elchee the difference between
a girl of a tribe and a citizen’s daughter.”
She instantly sprang upon the animal, and setting off
at full speed, did not stop till she had reached the
summit of a small hill in the vicinity, which was
covered with loose stones. When there, she waved
her hand over her head, and came down the hill at
the same rate at which she had ascended it. Nothing
could be more dangerous than the ground over
which she galloped; but she appeared quite fearless,
and seemed delighted at having the opportunity of
vindicating the females of her tribe from the reproach
of being like the ladies of cities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Shrubat-ur-Reech</span>, or <span class='it'>Drinkers of the Wind</span>,
reared by the Mongrabins of the West, are shaped
like greyhounds, and as spare as a bag of bones, but
their spirit and endurance of fatigue are prodigious.
On one occasion the chief of a tribe was robbed of a
favorite fleet animal of this race, and the camp went
out in pursuit eight hours after the theft. At night,
though the horse was not yet recovered, it was ascertained
that the pursuers had headed his track, and
would secure him before morning. The messenger
who returned with this intelligence, had ridden sixty
miles in the withering heat of the desert without
drawing bit. These animals are stated by Mr. Davidson,
to be fed only once in three days, when they
receive a large jar of camel’s milk; this, with an
occasional handful of dates, is their only food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fullest and most interesting account of the
Arab horse has been written by General Daumas,
and its value is greatly enhanced by containing a letter
on the subject, written entirely by the celebrated
Abd-’el-Kader, and a very remarkable document this
is. According to this high authority, a perfectly
sound Arab horse can, without difficulty, travel nearly
thirty miles daily for three or four months, without
resting a single day; and such a horse can accomplish
fifty <span class='it'>parasangs</span>—not less than two hundred
miles—in one day. When Abd-’el-Kader was with
his tribe at Melonia, they made <span class='it'>razzias</span> in the Djebel-amour,
pushing their horses at a gallop for five
or six hours without drawing bridle, and they accomplished
their expeditions in from twenty to twenty-five
days. During all this time their horses ate only
the corn carried by their riders, amounting to about
eight ordinary meals. They often drink nothing for
one or two days, and on one occasion were three days
without water. The Arabic language is very epigrammatic,
and the Arabs assign the reasons for instructing
their horses early in these proverbs: “The
lessons of infancy are graven in stone; but those of
age disappear like the nests of birds.” “The young
branch without difficulty straightens itself—the large
tree, never!” Accordingly, the instruction of the
horse begins in the first year. “If,” says the Emir,
“the horse is not mounted before the third year,
at the best he will only be good for the course; but
<span class='it'>that</span> he has no need of learning—it is his natural faculty.”
The Arabs thus express the idea, “<span class='it'>Le
djouad suivant sa race.</span>” The high bred horse has
no need of learning to run! The esteem of the
Arab for his horse is conveyed in the following sentiment
of the sage and saint, Ben-el-Abbas, which
has been handed down from generation to generation:
“Love thy horses—take care of them—spare
thyself no trouble; by them comes honor, and by
them is obtained beauty. If horses are abandoned
by others, I take them into my family; I share with
them and my children the bread; my wives cover
them with their veils, and wrap themselves in their
housings; I daily take them to the field of adventure;
and, carried away by their impetuous course,
I can fight with the most valiant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Daumas thus describes a combat between
two tribes, drawn from life, for he enjoyed many
opportunities for witnessing such scenes:—“The
horsemen of the two tribes are in front, the women
in the rear, ready to excite the combatants by their
cries and applause: they are protected by the infantry
who also form the reserve. The battle is commenced
by little bands of ten or fifteen horsemen,
who hover on the flanks, and seek to turn the enemy.
The chiefs, at the head of a compact body, form
the centre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Presently the scene becomes warm and animated—the
young cavaliers, the bravest and best mounted,
dash forward to the front, carried away by their ardor
and thirst for blood. They uncover their heads,
sing their war-songs, and excite to the fight by these
cries—‘Where are those who have mistresses? It
is under their eyes that the warriors fight to-day.
Where are those who by their chiefs always boast
of their valor? Now let their tongues speak loud,
and not in those babblings. Where are those who
run after reputation? Forward! forward! children
of powder! Behold these sons of Jews—our sabres
shall drink their blood—their goods we will give to
our wives!’ These cries inflame the horsemen—they
make their steeds bound, and unsling their guns—every
face demands blood—they mingle in the
fray, and sabre cuts are everywhere exchanged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“However, one of the parties has the worst of it,
and begins to fall back on the camels which carry
the women. Then are heard on both sides the women—on
the one, animating the conquerors by their
cries of joy—on the other, seeking to stimulate the
failing courage of their husbands and brothers by
their screams of anger and imprecation. Under
these reproaches the ardor of the vanquished returns,
and they make a vigorous effort. Supported by the fire
of the infantry who are in reserve, they recover their
ground, and throw back their enemy into the midst
of the women, who, in their turn, curse those whom
just before they had applauded. The battle returns
to the ground which lies between the females of the
tribes. At last, the party who have suffered most in
men and horses, who have sustained the greatest
loss, and have seen their bravest chiefs fall, take
flight in spite of the exhortations and prayers of those
bold men who, trying to rally them, fly right and
left, and try to recover the victory. Some warriors
still hold their ground, but the general route sweeps
them off. They are soon by their women—then
each, seeing that all is lost, occupies himself in saving
that which is dearest; they gain as much ground
as possible in their flight, turning from time to time
to face the pursuing enemy. The conquerors might
ruin them completely, if the intoxication of their
triumph did not build a bridge of gold for the vanquished,
but the thirst of pillage disbands them. One
despoils a footman—another a horseman: this one
seizes a horse—that a negro. Thanks to this disorder,
the bravest of the tribe save their wives, and
frequently their tents.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before 1800, no political mission from a European
nation had visited the court of Persia for a century;
but the English had fame as soldiers from the report
of their deeds in India. An officer of one of the
frigates which conveyed Sir John Malcolm’s mission,
who had gone ashore at Abusheher, and was
there mounted on a spirited horse, afforded no small
entertainment to the Persians by his bad horsemanship.
The next day the man who supplied the ship
with vegetables, and who spoke a little English, met
him on board, and said—“Don’t be ashamed, sir,
nobody knows you—bad rider! I tell them you, like
all English, ride well, but that time they see you,
<span class='it'>you very drunk</span>.” The worthy Persian thought it
would have been a reproach for a man of a warlike
nation not to ride well, but none for a European to
get drunk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A touching incident is mentioned by Mungo Park
as having occurred whilst he, friendless and forlorn,
was pursuing his weary journeyings far in the interior
of Africa. The simple narrative tells its own
tale of accumulated misery:—“July 29th. Early in
the morning my landlord observing that I was sickly,
hurried me away, sending a servant with me as a
guide to Kea. But though I was little able to walk,
my horse was still less able to carry me, and about
six miles to the east of Modibor, in crossing some
rough, clayey ground, he fell; and the united strength
of the guide and myself could not place him again
upon his legs. I sat down for some time beside this
worn-out associate of my adventures; but, finding
him still unable to rise, I took off the saddle and
bridle, and placed a quantity of grass before him. I
surveyed the poor animal as he lay panting on the
ground, with sympathetic emotion, for I could not
suppress the sad apprehension that I should myself
in a short time lie down and perish in the same manner,
of fatigue and hunger. With this foreboding I
left my poor horse, and with great reluctance I followed
my guide on foot along the bank of the river
until about noon, when we reached Kea, which I
found to be nothing more than a small fishing-village.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Torn with doubt and perplexity, heavy of heart
and weary in body, the unhappy traveler returned
westward to Modiboo, after two days’ journeying in
company with a negro carrying his horse accoutrements.
“Thus conversing,” says he, “we traveled
in the most friendly manner until, unfortunately, we
perceived the footsteps of a lion quite fresh in the
mud near the river side. My companion now proceeded
with great circumspection, and at last, coming
to some thick underwood, he insisted that I
should walk before him. I endeavored to excuse
myself by alleging that I did not know the road, but
he obstinately persisted; and after a few high words
and menacing looks, threw down the saddle and
went away. This very much disconcerted me, for
as I had given up all hopes of obtaining a horse, I
could not think of encumbering myself with a saddle;
and taking off the stirrups and girths, I threw
the saddle into the river. The Negro no sooner
saw me throw the saddle into the water than he
came running from among the bushes where he had
concealed himself, jumped into the river, and by help
of his spear brought out the saddle, and ran away
with it. I continued my course along the bank, but
as the wood was remarkably thick, and I had reason
to believe that a lion was at no great distance, I became
much alarmed, and took a long circuit through
the bushes to avoid him. About four in the afternoon
I reached Modiboo, where I found my saddle;
the guide, who had got there before me, being afraid
that I should inform the king of his conduct, had
brought the saddle with him in a canoe. While I
was conversing with the dooty, and remonstrating
with the guide for having left me in such a situation,
I heard a horse neigh in one of the huts, and the
dooty inquired with a smile if I knew who was
speaking to me. He explained himself by telling
me that my horse was still alive, and somewhat recovered
from his fatigue.” The happiness with
which Park met his lost faithful steed may be conceived,
for in him he had one friend left in the
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another lamented victim to African travel thus
touchingly laments a grievous misfortune which
befel him. Returning from an excursion to Kouka,
Major Denham writes:—“I was not at all prepared
for the news which was to reach me on returning to
our inclosure. The horse that had carried me from
Tripoli to Mourzuk and back again, and on which
I had ridden the whole journey from Tripoli to Bornou,
had died a very few hours after my departure
for the lake. There are situations in a man’s life in
which losses of this nature are felt most keenly, and
this was one of them. It was not grief, but it was
something very nearly approaching to it; and though
I felt ashamed of the degree of derangement which
I suffered from it, yet it was several days before I
could get over the loss. Let it, however, be remembered,
that the poor animal had been my support
and comfort—may I not say, companion?—through
many a dreary day and night—had endured
both hunger and thirst in my service with the utmost
patience—was so docile, though an Arab, that
he would stand still for hours in the desert while I
slept between his legs, his body affording me the
only shelter that could be obtained from the powerful
influence of a noonday sun: he was the fleetest
of the fleet, and ever foremost in the race.”<a id='r14'/><a href='#f14' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[14]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Brown, in his “Biographical Sketches of
Horses,” gives the following interesting account of
a circumstance that occurred at the Cape of Good
Hope. “In one of the violent storms that often occur
there, a vessel was forced on the rocks, and beaten
to pieces. The greater part of the crew perished
miserably, as no boat could venture to their assistance.
Meanwhile a planter came from his farm to
see the wreck, and knowing the spirit of his horse,
and his excellence as a swimmer, he determined to
make a desperate effort for their deliverance, and
pushed into the thundering breakers. At first both
disappeared, but were soon seen on the surface.
Nearing the wreck, he caused two of the poor seamen
to cling to his boots, and so brought them safe
to shore. Seven times did he repeat this perilous
feat, and saved fourteen lives; but, alas! the eighth
time, the horse being much fatigued, and meeting
with a formidable wave, the gallant fellow lost his
balance, and was overwhelmed in a moment. He
was seen no more, but the noble horse reached the
land in safety.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lieutenant Wellstead relates an adventure in his
travels in Arabia, which illustrates the importance
of being well mounted in that wild land:—“On my
return from Obri to Suweik, contrary to the wish of
the Bedouins, who had received intelligence that the
Wahhábis were lurking around, I left the village
where we had halted, alone, with my gun, in search
of game. Scarcely had I rode three miles from the
walls, when suddenly turning an angle of the rocks,
I found myself within a few yards of a group of about
a dozen horsemen who lay on the ground, basking
listlessly in the sun. To turn my horse’s head and
away was the work scarcely of an instant; but
hardly had I done so when the whole party were
also in their saddles in full cry after me. Several
balls whizzed past my head, which Sayyid acknowledged
by bounding forward like an antelope; he was
accustomed to these matters, and their desire to
possess him unharmed, alone prevented my pursuers
from bringing him down. As we approached
the little town I looked behind me; a sheikh better
mounted than his followers was in advance, his dress
and long hair streaming behind him, while he poised
his long spear on high, apparently in doubt whether
he was sufficiently within range to pierce me. My
good stars decided that he was not; for, reining up
his horse, he rejoined his party, whilst I gained the
walls in safety! The day before Sayyid came into
my hands he had been presented to the Im’am by a
Nejd sheikh; reared in domesticity, and accustomed
to share the tent of some Arab family, he possessed,
in an extraordinary degree, all the gentleness and
docility, as well as the fleetness, which distinguish
the pure breed of Arabia. To avoid the intense heat
and rest their camels, the Bedouins frequently halted
during my journey for an hour about mid-day. On
these occasions Sayyid would remain perfectly still
while I reposed on the sand, screened by the shadow
of his body. My noon repast of dates he always
looked for and shared. Whenever we halted, after
unsaddling him and taking off his bridle with my
own hands, he was permitted to roam about the encampment
without control. At sunset he came for
his corn at the sound of my voice, and during the
night, without being fastened, he generally took up
his quarters at a few yards from his master. During
my coasting voyages along the shore, he always
accompanied me, and even in a crazy open boat from
Maskat to India. My health having compelled me
to return to England overland, I could not in consequence
bring Sayyid with me. I parted with him
as from a tried and valued friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the North American Indians the Camanchees
take the first rank as equestrians; racing, indeed,
is with them a constant and almost incessant
exercise, and a fruitful source of gambling. Among
their feats of riding is one, described by Mr. Catlin,
as having astonished him more than any thing in the
way of horsemanship he had ever beheld; and it is a
stratagem of war familiar to every young man in the
tribe. At the instant he is passing an enemy, he
will drop his body upon the opposite side of the
horse, supporting himself with his heel upon the
horse’s back. In this position, lying horizontally, he
will hang whilst his horse is at its fullest speed, carrying
with him his shield, bow, and arrows, and
lance fourteen feet long, all or either of which he
will wield with the utmost facility, rising and throwing
his arrows over the horse’s back, or under his
neck, throwing himself up to his proper position, or
changing to the other side of the horse if necessary.
The actual way in which this is done is as follows:
A short hair halter is passed under the neck of the
horse, and both ends tightly braided into the mane,
leaving a loop to hang under the neck and against
the breast. Into this loop the rider drops his elbow
suddenly and fearlessly, leaving his heel to hang
over the back of the horse to steady him and enable
him to regain the upright position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following very singular custom prevails
among the tribe of North American Indians, known
as the <span class='it'>Foxes</span>. Of this Mr. Catlin was an eye-witness:
“When,” says he, “General Street and I
arrived at Kee-o-kuk’s village, we were just in time
to see this amusing scene on the prairie, a little back
of his village. The Foxes, who were making up a
war-party to go against the Sioux, and had not suitable
horses enough by twenty, had sent word to the
‘Sacs’ the day before, according to ancient custom,
that they were coming on that day, at a certain
hour, to ‘smoke’ that number of horses, and they
must not fail to have them ready. On that day, and
at the hour, the twenty young men who were beggars
for horses were on the spot, and seated themselves
on the ground in a circle, where they went to
smoking. The villagers flocked round them in a
dense crowd, and soon after appeared on the prairie,
at half a mile distance, an equal number of young
men of the Sac tribe, who had agreed each to give a
horse, and who were then galloping them round at
full speed; and gradually as they went around in a
circuit, coming nearer to the centre, until they were
at last close around the ring of young fellows seated
on the ground. Whilst dashing about thus each one
with a heavy whip in his hand, as he came within
reach of the group on the ground, selected the one
to whom he decided to present his horse, and as he
passed gave him the most tremendous cut with his
lash over the naked shoulders: and as he darted
around again, he plied the whip as before, and again
and again with a violent ‘crack,’ until the blood
could be seen trickling down over his naked shoulders,
upon which he instantly dismounted, and placed
the bridle and whip in his hands, saying, ‘Here, you
are a beggar; I present you a horse, but you will
carry my mark on your back.’ In this manner they
were all, in a little while, ‘whipped up,’ and each
had a good horse to ride home and into battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Catlin gives an interesting account of his faithful
horse “Charley,” a noble animal of the Camanchee
wild breed, which had formed as strong an
attachment for his master, as his master for him.
The two halted generally on the bank of some little
stream, and the first thing done was to undress Charley,
and drive down the picket to which he was fastened,
permitting him to graze over a circle limited
by his lasso. On a certain evening, when he was
grazing as usual, he managed to slip the lasso over
his head, and took his supper at his pleasure as he
was strolling round. When night approached, Mr.
Catlin took the lasso in hand, and endeavored to
catch him, but he continually evaded the lasso until
dark, when his master abandoned the pursuit, making
up his mind that he should inevitably lose him, and
be obliged to perform the rest of the journey on foot.
Returning to his bivouac, in no pleasant state of
mind, he laid down on his bear-skin and went to
sleep. In the middle of the night he awoke whilst
lying on his back, and, half opening his eyes, was
petrified at beholding, as he thought, the huge figure
of an Indian standing over him, and in the very act
of stooping to take his scalp! The chill of horror
that paralyzed him for the first moment, held him
still till he saw there was no need of moving; that
his faithful horse had played shy till he had filled his
belly, and had then moved up from feelings of pure
affection, and taken his position with his fore feet at
the edge of his master’s bed, and his head hanging
over him, in which attitude he stood fast asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When sunrise came the traveler awoke, and beheld
his faithful servant at a considerable distance, picking
up his breakfast among the cane-brake at the
edge of the creek. Mr. Catlin went busily to work
to prepare his own, and having eaten it, had another
half-hour of fruitless endeavors to catch Charley,
who, in the most tantalizing manner, would turn
round and round, just out of his master’s reach. Mr.
Catlin, recollecting the evidence of his attachment
and dependence, afforded by the previous night, determined
on another course of proceeding, so packed
up his traps, slung the saddle on his back, trailed his
gun, and started unconcernedly on his route. After
advancing about a quarter of a mile, he looked back
and saw Master Charley standing with his head and
tail very high, looking alternately at him and at the
spot where he had been encamped, and had left a
little fire burning. Thus he stood for some time,
but at length walked with a hurried step to the spot,
and seeing every thing gone, began to neigh very
violently, and, at last started off at fullest speed and
overtook his master, passing within a few paces of
him, and wheeling about at a few rods’ distance,
trembling like an aspen leaf. Mr. Catlin called him
by his familiar name, and walked up with the bridle
on his hand, which was put over Charley’s head, as
he held it down for it, and the saddle was placed on
his back as he actually stooped to receive it; when
all was arranged, and his master on his back, off
started the faithful animal as contented as possible.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Book of Ballads. Edited by Bon Gaultier. New
York: Redfield. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We are glad to see an elegant American edition of
these humorous ballads. In England they have long
enjoyed a wide reputation. Their authorship, though
vehemently debated, has not yet been settled, although
the honor is now considered to lie between Theodore
Martin and Professor W. E. Aytoun, the editor of Blackwood’s
Magazine. Bon Gaultier, whoever he may be,
is an universal satirist, whose sharp things are steeped
in a riotous humor that leaps all bounds of conventional
restraint. The general idea of the work is a parody of
the various styles of contemporary authors, and a caricature
of manners and persons, and this is executed with
great felicity of imitative talent, and in a spirit of such
wild glee as to take away the offensiveness of its occasional
malice. The Spanish Ballads, amid all their
elaborate buffoonery, are grand imitations of Lockhart’s
celebrated translations, evincing uncommon command
of energetic expression, and a keen perception of the
chivalrous spirit of the originals, and indicating in the
writer a ballad talent almost equal to that displayed by
Aytoun in his “Lays of the Scottish Cavaliers.” The
American Ballads are gross but laughable caricatures,
in which gouging, spitting, bragging, and drinking, are
made leading national characteristics, and the government
of the country represented as residing in an aristocracy
of the bowie-knife. The following, from the
American’s Apostrophe to Boz, contains an inimitable
antithesis of sentiment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The best of the American ballads is “The Death of
Jabez Dollar,” originally published in Frazer’s Magazine,
and founded on a newspaper report of one of our
Congressional affrays. The caricature is so broad that
the most patriotic American can hardly take offense, and
we quote it as a splendid specimen, in versification and
sentiment, of the heroic in ruffianism;</p>

<p class='line0'>The Congress met, the day was wet, Van Buren took the chair,</p>
<p class='line0'>On either side, the statesman pride of far Kentuck was there;</p>
<p class='line0'>With moody frown, there ate Calhoun, and slowly in his cheek</p>
<p class='line0'>His quid he thrust, and slaked the dust, as Webster rose to speak.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Upon that day, near gifted Clay, a youthful member sat,</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>And like a free American upon the floor he spat;</span></p>
<p class='line0'>Then turning round to Clay, he said, and wiped his manly chin,</p>
<p class='line0'>“What kind of Locofoco’s that, as wears the painter’s skin?”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Young man,” quoth Clay, “avoid the way of Slick of Tennessee,</p>
<p class='line0'>Of gougers fierce, the eyes that pierce, the fiercest gouger he.</p>
<p class='line0'>He chews and spits, as there he sits, and whittles at the chairs,</p>
<p class='line0'>And in his hand, for deadly strife, a bowie-knife he bears.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Avoid that knife! in frequent strife its blade, so long and thin,</p>
<p class='line0'>Has found itself a resting place his rival’s ribs within.”</p>
<p class='line0'>But coward fear came never near young Jabez Dollar’s heart;</p>
<p class='line0'>“Were he an alligator, I would rile him pretty smart!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Then up he rose, and cleared his nose, and looked toward the chair,</p>
<p class='line0'>He saw the stately stars and stripes—our country’s flag was there!</p>
<p class='line0'>His heart beat high, with savage cry upon the floor he sprang,</p>
<p class='line0'>Then raised his wrist, and shook his fist, and spoke his first harangue.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Who sold the nutmegs made of wood, the clocks that wouldn’t figure?</p>
<p class='line0'>Who grinned the bark off gum-trees dark—the everlasting nigger?</p>
<p class='line0'>For twenty cents, ye Congress gents, through ’tarnity I’ll kick</p>
<p class='line0'>That man, I guess, though nothing less than coon-faced Colonel Slick!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>The Colonel smiled—with frenzy wild—his very beard waxed blue—</p>
<p class='line0'>His shirt it could not hold him, so wrathy riled he grew;</p>
<p class='line0'>He foams and frets, his knife he whets upon his seat below—</p>
<p class='line0'>He sharpens it on either side, and whittles at his toe;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Oh! waken snakes, and walk your chalks!” he cried, with ire elate,</p>
<p class='line0'>“Darn my old mother but I will in wild cats whip my weight!</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh! ’tarnel death, I’ll spoil your breath, young Dollar, and your chaffing—</p>
<p class='line0'>Look to your ribs, for here is that will tickle them without laughing!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>His knife he raised—with fury crazed he sprang across the hall—</p>
<p class='line0'>He cut a caper in the air—he stood before them all:</p>
<p class='line0'>He never stopped to look or think if he the deed should do,</p>
<p class='line0'>But spinning sent the president, and on young Dollar flew.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>They met—they closed—they sunk—they rose—in vain young Dollar strove—</p>
<p class='line0'>For, like a streak of lightning greased, the infuriate colonel drove</p>
<p class='line0'>His bowie blade deep in his side, and to the ground they rolled,</p>
<p class='line0'>And, drenched in gore, wheeled o’er and o’er, locked in each other’s hold.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>With fury dumb—with nail and thumb—they struggled and they thrust—</p>
<p class='line0'>The red blood ran from Dollar’s side, like rain upon the dust;</p>
<p class='line0'>He nerved his might for one last spring, and as he sunk and died,</p>
<p class='line0'>Reft of an eye, his enemy fell groaning at his side.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Thus did he fall within the hall of Congress, that brave youth;</p>
<p class='line0'>The bowie-knife hath quenched his life of valor and of truth;</p>
<p class='line0'>And still among the statesmen throng at Washington they tell,</p>
<p class='line0'>How nobly Dollar gouged his man—how gallantly he fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The miscellaneous ballads in the volume are very
numerous, and in all varieties of the ballad style.
Moore, Bulwer, Macaulay, Tennyson, Hunt, and other
poets of the day, have some of their most popular lays
felicitously parodied. Bon Gaultier must be a poet,
or he could not so completely catch the very spirit and
movement of the poets he caricatures. Among the best
of these ballads are those which exhibit the contest for
the laureatship, and the mockery of Tennyson’s style is
especially ludicrous. “A Midnight Meditation,” purporting
to be by Bulwer, represents that fascinating
novelist as admitting, in soliloquy, the essential falsehood
of sentiment which characterizes so many of his
writings. He is exhibited as drinking in inspiration
from London porter, and holding sweet coloquy with
himself on the success of his numerous shams. “I
know,” he says,</p>

<p class='line0'>There should Apollo’s bays be budding now:—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And in my flashing eyes the radiance beams,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;That marks the poet in his waking dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This last line really hits the truth of the matter, and
raises Bon Gaultier into the class of interpretative
critics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The style of Leigh Hunt is familiarly known, and the
exquisiteness of the following parody can be generally
appreciated. It is worthy of Hunt himself, and might
have been written by him in one of his cosiest dallyings
with the “well of English undefiled.” The argument
is that an impassioned pupil of Hunt met Gaultier at a
ball, and thus declares the consequences:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duke of Wellington is known as the “iron”

<p class='pindent'>We commend this volume very cordially to our readers
as one of the best things of the kind in English literature.
It appears to us better even than the Rejected
Addresses, in the richness and breadth of its humor, and
in the poetry of its mirth. Whoever may be the author,
it is evidently the production of one capable of writing
excellent serious poetry of his own, as well as parodying
that of his contemporaries.</p>

opinion the genius of the author; for that he has genius
is undeniable. It is not a novel—not a romance—not a
book of travels—not a half-theological, half-controversial,
all-indecent, tract in the guise of any one of the
three. But it is a fine tissue of humor, wit, adventure,
pathos, and description, woven into just enough of active
and moving story to create a living interest—it is,
in short, the seeings, thinkings, and in some sort, perhaps,
the doings, of a clear-sighted, enthusiastical
traveler, at once a man of the world and a scholar, with
the eye of an artist, the tongue of a poet, the heart of a
mountaineer over “at home among the rocks,” a bit of
a Pantagruelist withal, who has seen much, pondered
much, learned much, and has much to say about many
countries, many things, and many people, which and
who are really worth being seen, thought, and heard of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the style of his romance and incident our readers
may judge from the scene in his preface, wherein the
narrator becomes acquainted with his hero, Hugh Pynnshurst,
and we think it cannot fail to impress them with
an idea of his power; although power is not, we think,
so decidedly his forte, as quaint humor, and shrewd,
original, bold-spoken and fearless appreciation and criticism
of men, books, and things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One day, on the Faulhorn, I met a person who
looked like a countryman, saluted him and passed by.
We were on the edge of a precipice, walking upon a
level road about seven feet wide. On one side was the
perpendicular rock; but, at its outer line, the road
shelved abruptly to the edge of the precipice which hung
over an awful chasm three hundred feet in depth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was snow a foot deep upon it. I heard one
half-muffled cry, and turned to see what I trust never
to see again. He had walked too near the outer edge,
and the snow had slipped from under him, and in an instant
he was three feet from the line of the level, and
slowly, slowly, the snow was yielding to his weight,
and slowly, but ceaselessly, he slided toward the brink,
carrying the white mass with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not any other cry escaped him; but he raised his
wild, black eyes to mine as I stood opposite him. There
was beauty on his face, but it was white, white with
horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A yard, perhaps, of space was between his feet now
and the edge, and his hands were griping convulsively
at the rock left bare above him, at the cold and slippery
stone; and without pause, but yet more fearful for its
slowness, it went on, as you have seen the wreathe
upon the house-top sliding downward at the noon-day
thaw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had a large Scotch plaid, and setting my staff in a
crevice, and held firmly by my guide, I cast the end toward
him, and as his foot passed the ledge, he caught
the fringe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the moment’s pause, I noticed his position. One
leg was cramped up under him; one foot hung over the
deep; the lips were set so firmly, and were so white, that
I could barely see their line. Only the large black eyes
kept their awful look on mine; the hands had burst the
gloves in their terrible gripe upon the fringe; the fringe
was sewed upon the plaid, and as I looked, it parted!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I closed my eyes, and sickened, and fell back upon
the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I recovered from my stupor, my guide was
filling my mouth with <span class='it'>kirschenwasser</span>, and the stranger
was standing at my feet. His face was still colorless;
a face of ineffable pride. But as I rose wonderingly, he
took off his hat and said in a sweet voice a few simple
thanks for the service I had rendered him. In my terror,
I had not noticed that, as the plaid-fringe began to give
way, my guide had gotten his rope loose and had thrown
it to the stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was thus that he was saved; and it was thus that
an acquaintance began between us, which soon ripened
into an earnest friendship. They are scraps from his
experience that you will find here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is all the preface which I have to offer. If you
like it—Well! If you like it not—Well! Peace be
with you! and may your lives be as long and as tough
as that of our ‘<span class='it'>last</span> relic of the Revolution’ who has
died eleven times a month, ever since I was born, and
continues to renew the phenomenon weekly, up to date.
Hail, and farewell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A fair estimate may be formed of the quaint and peculiar
blending of something nearly approaching to sublimity
and pathos with queer characteristic drollery,
which is one of our author’s peculiarities, from</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He had very few impressions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The feeling of immensity so much talked about came
not to him; the waves never looked like mountains, nor
their intervals like abysses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One storm they had, but it impressed him nothing
like a storm in one of the grand, old forests on the shore;
the wind was too free to act as it pleased; the ship only
creaked; the cordage merely whistled, and there were
gay, noisy songs from the sailors, and loud, rough bellowings
from the officers, which added nothing to the
dignity of the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not like the mystic stillness that falls upon the land,
when the horizon begins to darken the first frown of the
storm. When the birds are hushed in the forest, and
the aspen leaf ceases to quiver, and the pall of the tempest
spreads slowly over all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then the shiver, as the first breath sweeps along
the sky, and the low, far sound of the thunder gives
warning of its approach; and the fierce excitement as
the tempest comes sounding on, marshaling the armies
of the clouds, increasing fast and loud the roars of their
artillery; then the first shudder of the forest as the blast
of the strong wind strikes it, and the mighty trees bow
down, and rise again, and toss their huge arms, battling
with the blast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These were the storms that thrilled him. He could
moan with the moaning wood; he could struggle with
the strong oak’s struggling; he felt himself o’erthrown,
as the lightning crushed it to the earth; and when the
calm and the silence had followed, he could say to his
pride of heart, ‘Thou seest how vain and how feeble
is the might of the creature when it warreth with its
God.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the rest, he wondered that it did not make the
porpoises dizzy to turn so many somersets; and when
the hawks caught Mother Carey’s chickens, and brought
them on board to eat them, he noticed that the little
things were very fat, and presumed that but for their
fishy taste, they would be very good in a pot-pie.”</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Men and Women of the Eighteenth Century. By Arsene
Houssaye. New York: Redfield. 2 vols. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This volume gives the most vivid picture of the manners,
morals, and government of France during the
latter part of the reign of Louis XIV., and the whole of
that of Louis XV., we have ever seen. It enables the
reader to understand the real character of that <span class='it'>Ancien
Régime</span> which was overthrown by the Revolution of
1789, and exhibits a state of society bereft of all moral
vigor, licentious, lazy, impudent, debilitated, dissolute,
without religion, without shame, without any depth of
passion, and superficial even in its wickedness. The
author of the sketches, himself a Frenchman without
much austerity of principle, glances lightly over his
themes, bringing out with a certain French refinement
of perception and phrase all the piquant littlenesses
of his subject, and, a wit himself, taking great delight in
making his readers familiar with the wit of others. He
has sacked all the many memoirs of the time for materials;
has selected with a nice tact all their stimulating
matter, without burdening his page with their trash;
and, before attempting the task of composition, evidently
familiarized his imagination with the persons and
events he describes, so that they moved before him
picturesquely, enveloped in their own peculiar atmosphere.
The result is quite a dramatic exhibition of
kings, princesses, ministers of state, royal and noble
mistresses, authors, poets, comedians, actresses, philosophers,
artists, atheists, and <span class='it'>savans</span>, discriminated in
their kind from all others, yet still agreeing with the
radical principles of human nature, as those principles
were combined in the Frenchman of the eighteenth century,
and in a court in which virtue was a jest, vice a
distinction, infamy a fashion, and marriage vows as false
as dicers’ oaths. The sketch of Louis XV. and Madame
de Pompadour of the Crebillons, of Buffon, of
Cardinal de Bernis, of Mademoiselle Clarion, of Sophie
Arnould, of the Duc de Richelieu, (the universal rake,)
of Dufresnoy, Marivaux, Dorat, Poson, Fontenelle, and
La Fontaine, are representative of the whole. The
society described is pretty well summed up by Crebillon,
as consisting of “ruined gentlemen living upon their
neighbors, rich actresses living with ruined gentlemen.”
To an American, the most remarkable thing in the whole
representation is the easy suspension of all moral rules
whatever in this “good company.” Before he gets
half through the book he almost forgets that there is
such a thing as duty, or religion, or morality, or glory,
or any thing but five senses, in human nature. He feels
that the whole structure implies a frightful amount of
misgovernment and oppression at home, and of scandalous
mismanagement abroad, that France is given up
to the plunder of roués and harlots, but the style of
Arsene Houssaye is so smooth, and his epigrams so airy
and keen, and the felicities he quotes so sparkling, that
the whole representation seems to justify itself, and to
exhibit quite a delightful scheme of government, “with
youth at the prow and pleasure at the helm.” Indeed,
though the book is invaluable as a picture of a defunct
social state, it becomes tiresome at last with all its
brightness and novelty, and the necessity of some affectation
at least of noble sentiment is painfully felt to relieve
the monotony of its brilliant baseness—some smiting
sentences, here and there, to rend the gauzy veil that
these flippant libertines have spread over the pandemonium
on which their delicious palace of pleasure is
built. The Louis the Fifteenth, whose court these
volumes describe, is the same Louis whose death was thus
announced by an eminent priest to the mob of courtiers
who had shared with their monarch the pillage of France:
“Louis, the well-beloved, sleeps in the Lord!” “If
each a mass of laziness and lust sleep in the Lord, who,
think you, sleeps elsewhere?” is Carlyle’s fierce
answer.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>A Legend of the Waldenses, and Other Tales. By Mary
B. Windle. William Moore: Philadelphia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We take some reproach to ourselves for having omitted
to notice the third edition of this very unpretending
but very agreeable little volume, which has been on our
table for some time past, from the pen of an accomplished
lady contributor to many of our monthly magazines. It
has decided merit in itself, and gives promise of yet more
when the fair writer shall wield a more exercised pen.
The style is graceful and pleasant, though occasionally
marred by an incorrectly formed and inharmonious word,
such, for instance, as “Huguenotic,” where the <span class='it'>ic</span> is
superfluous as to sense, and ungrateful as to sound.
The descriptions of scenery are fresh and vivid; the
characters often well conceived and forcibly drawn, and
the incidents and conversations quite up to, if not above,
the ordinary standard of historical romance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story which we like the most is that styled “The
Lady of the Rock,” a tale of the trial and execution of
the most unfortunate, though not the worst, of kings,
Charles the First; who was, in truth, a martyr to principles
which he undoubtedly believed to be true, and
who died, rather because he would not yield prerogatives
which were behind the age in which it was his
unhappy fate to live, than because he grasped at powers
unused by previous monarchs, or unauthorized by the
then constitution. In this very able sketch the characters
of the discrowned king, of the stern fanatic, Cromwell,
of the serene and stately Milton, are delineated
with rare truth and fidelity, and with a vigor which is
equaled by few contemporary novelists. This tale, above
any other in the volume, leads us to believe that the authoress
might be successful were she to try her hand in
a wider field of historical romance; should she do so,
however, she must avoid, as in the tale called “Florence
de Rohan,” wandering too far from the truth of actual
history of well known personages; for it is an absolute
rule of historico-romantic composition, that, although
events and actions, which never really occurred, may be
legitimately ascribed to real personages, provided they
are in character and keeping with time, place, and person—real
events, and real actions, if related at all, must
be related as they occurred. In a word, that although
it is allowable to add, it is forbidden to detract aught
from the truth of history.</p>

&amp; Co. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is hardly necessary to say to any of our readers interested
in the history or analysis of the English language,
that the author of this learned and able volume
is the latest and the best authority in the matter of which
it treats. The preface to the present American edition
asserts but the simple truth, when it declares that “Dr.
Latham now takes rank among the ablest Ethnologists
of the age, and that few have been more successful in
unraveling the difficulties that involve the origin and
formation of the English tongue, in its connection with
our early history as a people. He has brought the
labors of all who have written upon the various ramifications
of the Indo-European languages, to bear upon
the elucidation of our mother tongue, with an acuteness
of criticism and a breadth of view, that distances all
his predecessors or contemporaries in the same field.”
It may be added also that Dr. Latham’s method and
style are in pleasing contrast to the wavering, uncertain,
choose-for-yourself-between-two-ways manner,
characteristic of many philologists. His analysis penetrates
to the core of the matter, and processes and results
are stated with an austere condensation of language,
which is jealous of one useless word. As a
work wherein to obtain definite ideas of the history and
grammatical structure of our language, we do not know
its equal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The interest, so general all over the civilized world, felt
in every thing which relates to Franklin’s Expedition,
will command for this volume an extensive circulation.
Sir John Richardson’s account of his long voyage is
especially valuable for the large amount of information
it gives respecting the climate, the physical geography,
the plants, and the Indians of the regions he visited.
He has the accurate observation of the man of science,
with something of a humorist’s eye for character, and
his details of his winter quarters among the Chepewyans
is quite amusing as well as instructive. Throughout
the volume there is an entire absence of pretension and
exaggeration, and every page adds to the reader’s first
favorable impression of the author’s modesty, energy,

<p class='pindent'>This is the first of a series of volumes, to be published
under the general title of “Appleton’s Popular Library,”

very elegant. The present volume is a good beginning.
It consists of essays, selected from the literary department
of the London Times, and the production, we believe,
of the author of “Caleb Stukely,”—a powerful
novel which appeared some years ago in Blackwood’s
Magazine. The style is bold, clear, decisive, end
business-like, and the matter very attractive. The essay
on Lord Nelson and Lady Hamilton is full of information
which must be new to a majority of readers, and evinces
a complete mastery of the subject. Not less interesting
are the essays on the Orleans family, beginning with
the profligate Regent of that name, and ending with the
late King of the French. The infamy in the family’s
annals is brought startlingly out. The successive
children of the house seem, to use an expression of old
Dr. South, “to have been, not so much born, as damned,
into the world.” The essays on Southey, Chantrey,
Keats, and Ancient Egypt, are likewise excellent.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
